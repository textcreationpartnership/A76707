         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Thus you ſee that this Scripture, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſeveral parts, or branches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, together with their number, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, do very fitly and exquiſitely comply with the nature of a Covenant. And now I ſhall endeavour to make good that theſe ſix parts, or members herein contained, are altogether proper and eſſential to the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to that purpoſe: In the firſt branch, conſiſting of the <hi>Covenanters:</hi> I ſhall make appear. Firſt, That there is ſuch a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, as the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, By whom this Covenant of Grace was made: Thirdly, With whom it was made.</p>
               <p>And fourthly, when it was made.</p>
               <p>For the firſt: Although we finde not, that the word of <hi>God</hi> hath ſet forth unto us this <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> under that very Notion, or expreſſion of the Covenant of Grace. <hi>In totidem ſyllabis,</hi> as we ſay: In juſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:123675:9"/> ſyllables, or in the very ſelf-ſame words. Yet (by the conſideration of ſome few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars) I doubt not, but I ſhall ſettle it very ſtrongly, even upon the weakeſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions.</p>
               <p>For we finde that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or made, many Promiſes, Grants, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements, or the like Conveyances, under the name, or ſtile of <hi>Covenants. I will eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish; my Covenant with you: and with your ſeed after you,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. 9. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſame day the Lord made a Covenant with</hi> Abraham, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 18.</p>
               <p>Which not long after he confirmed in theſe words: <hi>And I will eſtabliſh my Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee in their generations, for an everlaſting Covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy ſeed after thee,</hi> Gen. 17. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>And oftentimes in the ſame 17. Chapter he urgeth the ſaid <hi>Covenant.</hi> He command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth obedience thereunto, verſ. 9. And ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it with the ſign of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> verſ. 11. <hi>The ſeal of the righteouſneſſe of faith,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 4. 11.</p>
               <p>Again, we read of the <hi>book of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:</hi> And of the <hi>bloud of the Covenant,</hi> Exod. 24. 7, 8.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:123675:9"/>
               <p> And truely theſe, and the like, were no other then repreſentations, or manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or confirmations of this, which we call the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In like manner the <hi>Covenant of peace,</hi> Iſa. 54. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Covenant of the Redeemer,</hi> Iſa. 59. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The everlaſting Covenant,</hi> Jer. 32. 40.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The new Covenant,</hi> promiſed, Jer. 31. 31. and repeated, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 16, 17. were Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants for Reconciliation, Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Sanctification. All which (toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with every other of the like nature) are but as ſo many Members, which do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their very life, and being from, and by, the virtue of this original Covenant for <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Salvation:</hi> which we call the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> The name and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance whereof are very well preſented unto us in that typical Covenant, extended lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to <hi>David:</hi> but intended really to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Son of <hi>David;</hi> in theſe words: <hi>My mercy will I keep for him for ever more: and my Covenant ſhall ſtand faſt with him. His ſeed alſo will I make to endire for ever: and his Throne as the dayes of Heaven. If his Children forſake my law, and walk not in my judgements; If they break my ſtatutes, and</hi>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:123675:10"/> 
                  <hi>keep not my Commandments; Then will I viſit their tranſgreſſion with the Rod, and their iniquity with Stripes. Nevertheleſſe, my loving kindeneſſe will I not utterly take from him: nor ſuffer my faithfulneſſe to fail. My Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89. 28. to the 35.</p>
               <p>Thus are we warranted to call this grand evidence of our Salvation by the name of a <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               <p>And now, that I may reſolve you, in a word, why we call it the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be pleaſed to conſider: That <hi>God</hi> gave unto <hi>Adam</hi> great poſſeſſions and privileges by way of Covenant. But revocable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive alſo in caſe of his diſobedience thereunto, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Adam</hi> rebels to his eternal ruine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, without the leaſt deſert, or deſire of his: He is not onely reprived, but alſo reſtored unto favour, by vertue of another Covenant: Inplied in the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the <hi>ſeed of the woman,</hi> Gen. 3. 15.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:123675:10"/>
               <p> And doth not that deſerve to be called the <hi>Covenant of Grace?</hi> And not onely <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> but <hi>we alſo have all ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God: But are juſtified freely by his Grace,</hi> Rom. 3. 23, 24. <hi>Yea, ye al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo were dead in ſins, but by Grace ye are ſaved,</hi> Eph. 2. 5.</p>
               <p>And all by virtue of this <hi>Covenant,</hi> which is therefore moſt worthily called: <hi>The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We come now in the ſecond particular to ſhew you, By whom this <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> was made. And I truſt I ſhall not need to take much pains therein. For I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that whoſoever can believe that there was a <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> made with the World, for redemption and ſalvation: they cannot doubt, but <hi>God</hi> was the onely au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour thereof.</p>
               <p>It was <hi>God that was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19.</p>
               <p>And it is <hi>the grace of God, that bringeth ſalvation,</hi> Tit. 2. 11.</p>
               <p>And the onely true light hath made it moſt manifeſt here in this Text. <hi>God ſo loved the World. God the father:</hi> for he gave his <hi>onely begotten ſon. God:</hi> that great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and onely wiſe diſpoſer of all things, both in heaven and in earth.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:123675:11"/>
               <p> Who, having created the firſt man <hi>in his own Image,</hi> Gen. 1. 27.</p>
               <p>That is (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) In knowledge,</hi> Col. 3. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe,</hi> Eph. 4. 24.</p>
               <p>He gave him dominion over the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 28.</p>
               <p>Stated him in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> Gen. 2. 8. A place abounding with all, and all manner of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe and pleaſure, and plenty. And for the more ſecure and ſetled injoyment of the ſame: He promiſed him everlaſting life; whereof <hi>the tree of life,</hi> Gen. 2. 9. was the ſymbole, ſign, or token. To have and hold all the ſaid premiſſes, priviledges, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives to him, and his heirs for ever. And all this by way of <hi>Covenant:</hi> upon condition of the ſaid <hi>Adams</hi> obedience to the whole will of God. Notwithſtanding, the onely <hi>Proviſo,</hi> expreſſed, conſiſted in his abſtinence from the tree of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evil: and this under the penalty of eternal death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
               <p>This is that which we call the <hi>Covenant of works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And which the word of <hi>God</hi> commonly calleth the <hi>Law.</hi> The matter, or ſubſtance whereof is exemplified in the Moral Law, or
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:123675:11"/> the Law of the ten Commandments, <hi>Ex.</hi> 20. which is ſometimes called: <hi>The works of the Law,</hi> Gal. 2. 16. And ſometimes <hi>the Law of works,</hi> Rom. 3. 27. But <hi>Adam,</hi> careleſſe of his bleſt eſtate, believes the Devil rather then his <hi>God.</hi> Inſomuch that he neglects his Maker, and Maſter: And, deſpiſing his Covenant, breaks the condition.</p>
               <p>By which rebellion, he incurs the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and pulls the woefull ruines of miſery, death, and condemnation upon himſelf, and his whole poſterity.</p>
               <p>Yet this good <hi>God,</hi> this much offended Majeſty, notwithſtanding this his juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of eternal diſpleaſure: <hi>So loved the World,</hi> that he confirmed this <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> wherein <hi>He gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am now, in the third particular, to ſhew you; with whom this <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> was made. Expreſſed here under this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>The World; God ſo loved the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We finde that the <hi>holy Ghoſt</hi> hath applied this word <hi>World,</hi> to ſeveral ſenſes and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications.</p>
               <p>It is uſed for the habitable places of the world: for the univerſal frame of the world: and for the Inhabitants of the world. All
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:123675:12"/> in one verſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 10. For mankind, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 29. For the whole earth, <hi>Math.</hi> 4. 8. For the riches, or the wealth of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 26. For the pleaſures, luſts, and delights of the worlds <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 14.</p>
               <p>But here in this place, it is reſtrained onely unto <hi>Man,</hi> or <hi>Mankinde:</hi> As being the onely Creature in the world, that was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch a Covenant: And unto whom it was altogether needfull, and abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. So that it cannot otherwiſe be: But that this <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> was made with Man, or Mankinde.</p>
               <p>Yet not with the firſt man: who did ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deveſt and deprive himſelf of all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility for ſuch a glorious enterpriſe, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, by his diſobedience to the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rks.</hi> Neither was it made with any of his ſeed after the fleſh: I mean after a fleſhly generation. For if <hi>fleſh and bloud cannot inherit the Kingdom of God:</hi> As in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 50. much leſſe could fleſh and bloud recover their loſt title to the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt know, that upon the firſt mans breach of Covenant, <hi>God</hi> &amp; <hi>Man</hi> were part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>Man</hi> flies from <hi>God</hi> in fear: and <hi>God</hi> could not follow man, but in fury. Neither could any reconcile them: but he, that muſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:123675:12"/> be both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man: Man,</hi> that ſo he might ſuffer for the ſin of Man: And <hi>God,</hi> that ſo he might ſatisfie the juſtice of <hi>God.</hi> For <hi>Adams</hi> diſobedience had made <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> enemies: Now, it is not to be imagined that one enemy will make a league, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with another, but either out of fear: And far be it from the <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> to be ſubject to any ſuch paſſion: or upon ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which to poor decayed man was a thing impoſſible.</p>
               <p>And, notwithſtanding <hi>Gods</hi> love towards his loſt creature: and his pity towards the diſtreſſed, helpleſſe, hopeleſſe Soul might plead for mercie, pardon, and compaſſion: Yet juſtice might not, could not be abuſed without <hi>Gods</hi> infinite diſhonour, in whom it is eſſential.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, the mercie of <hi>God</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with his wiſdom (not againſt his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; but) to finde out a means, whereby to ſatisfie his juſtice: that ſo his righteouſneſſe might be vindicated: his wrath appeaſed: and Man might be impartially reſtored. <hi>And he ſaw that there was no Man, and wondred</hi> (or conſidered) <hi>that there was no interceſſour: Therefore his arm brought ſalvation unto him,</hi> Iſa. 59. 16. <hi>His arm:</hi> That is: <hi>His ſon Chriſt,</hi> According to that of the ſame Evangelical
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:123675:13"/> Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 1. <hi>unto whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? For he ſhall grow up before him as a tender plant.</hi> And ſo he goes on with a Propheſie of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in that whole Chapter.</p>
               <p>Or if you will underſtand the <hi>arm of God,</hi> for the <hi>power of God:</hi> according to the more uſual conſtruction: Yet that alſo ſhall direct us to <hi>Chriſt. For he is the power of God, and the wiſdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 24.</p>
               <p>We muſt know, and conſider, that man, by his fall, was ſo broken and disjoynted, that he became too weak for ſuch a weighty burthen, as that of eternal redemption. Therefore the <hi>Lord laid help upon one that is mighty,</hi> Pſalm 89. 19. <hi>Mighty to ſave,</hi> Iſa. 63. 1. Moreover, God might not, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, yield to man his enemy: But he could not, in gentleneſſe, deny his only <hi>ſon: The ſon of his boſom,</hi> John 1. 18. <hi>In whom his Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth,</hi> Iſa. 42. 1. <hi>who doth alwayes thoſe things that pleaſe him,</hi> Joh. 8. 29. Nay, he could not, in juſtice, refuſe a competent ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: from the hand of ſuch an <hi>High-Prieſt, as is able to ſave them to the uttermoſt, that come unto God by him,</hi> Heb. 7. 24.</p>
               <p>And to that very purpoſe <hi>Chriſt came forth from God,</hi> Joh. 16. 28. <hi>To overcome the evil of the world,</hi> verſ. 33. And <hi>God was in Chriſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:123675:13"/> 
                  <hi>reconciling the World unto himſelf,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19. Thus you ſee with whom this <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> was made.</p>
               <p>Not with the World univerſally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded; Nor with mankinde ſimply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered: But with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man;</hi> who being very <hi>God:</hi> Yet he took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the very nature of <hi>Man,</hi> that ſo he might ſuffer for mans diſobedience on mans behalf. Not to aboliſh, or deſtroy the law, or the <hi>Covenant of works:</hi> which man tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed to his own confuſion. <hi>For, till hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth paſſe, one jot, or one title ſhall in no wiſe paſſe from the law, till all be fulfilled,</hi> Mat. 5. 18.</p>
               <p>But to fulfill the ſaid law in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for, and on the behalf of all believers. And ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>the end of the law for righteouſneſſe to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 10. 4.</p>
               <p>For which cauſe he is likewiſe called the laſt <hi>Adam.</hi> Becauſe like as the firſt Adam, as a publick perſon received the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> for himſelf and all his poſterity, and brake it: to their utter ruine, and univerſal undoing.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the ſecond, or laſt <hi>Adam,</hi> as the publick head of his Church, hath underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the perfect performance of the ſame
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:123675:14"/> 
                  <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> in the name and place of all believers: which he ſhall moſt exactly fulfill, and keep for them, even unto the end of the world.</p>
               <p>And therefore I may confidently ſay to all true believers, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the Saints at Rome: <hi>Ye are not under the law, but under grace,</hi> Rom. 6. 14.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath, doth, and will obſerve, and accompliſh the whole <hi>Law,</hi> as it is the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> for us: That ſo he may eſtate, and ſettle us in this <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> in, and by himſelf onely, &amp; for ever. He being, in truth, the very eſſence, the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entire being thereof: With whom: For whom: In whom: And by whom the ſaid <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> was made, granted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and delivered.</p>
               <p>With whom it was made: For he is the <hi>Surety of the Covenant,</hi> Hebr. 7. 22.</p>
               <p>For whom it was granted: For he is the <hi>Mediatour of the Covenant,</hi> Hebr. 8. 6.</p>
               <p>In whom it was confirmed: For he is the <hi>Seed of the Covenant,</hi> Gal. 3. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>And by whom it is delivered: For he is the <hi>Meſſenger of the Covenant,</hi> Mal. 3. 1.</p>
               <p>We paſſe on now to the fourth particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: wherein we are to conſider when this <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> was made. I ſhall not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:123675:14"/> ſtand to ſtrive with thoſe unwarrantable opinions that are, or have been offered and received, in reference to the <hi>Date</hi> of this Covenant. But I ſhall prove by Scripture, and ſuch truths as will conclude from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; that it was framed from eternity.</p>
               <p>For firſt, we finde that <hi>Adam,</hi> ſoon after his creation, having ſinned againſt <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>Covenant of works:</hi> through the ſeduce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Satan: Immediately thereupon the <hi>Lord,</hi> in the preſence of Adam, curſed that old Serpent: And denounced his deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the <hi>Seed of the woman;</hi> which was <hi>Chriſt,</hi> Gen. 3. 14, 15. To Satans confuſion, and mans conſolation And truely it is to be conceived, that <hi>God</hi> would not ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, and ſo certainly have ſet forth his <hi>Son</hi> for the <hi>Saviour,</hi> at that very inſtant, had there not been ſome pre-contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verily he was fore-ordained before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the World,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 20.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we read that <hi>Abel,</hi> the ſecond ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> did offer unto <hi>God</hi> a more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſacrifice then <hi>Cain,</hi> the firſt born. And this was by <hi>faith,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, Hebr. 11. 4.</p>
               <p>Now this faith of his could not have been
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:123675:15"/> ſo effectual, had it not been built upon ſome ſure foundation.</p>
               <p>And what might that be? His own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe in order unto the <hi>Covenant of works?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely, No: He could not but know that to be a falſe ground: for it ſunk under his father; whereby both they, and we became liable to death and deſtruction. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Abels</hi> faith muſt of neceſſity be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon ſome ſuch promiſe, as that of eternal life: <hi>which God that cannot lie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed before the world began,</hi> Titus 1. 2.</p>
               <p>And to whom might this promiſe be made before the World began? But to <hi>Chriſt the wiſdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 24. <hi>who was ſet up from everlaſting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was,</hi> Prov. 8. 23.</p>
               <p>Nor can we imagine, that this promiſe of eternal life, was made by <hi>God the Father,</hi> but upon ſome conditions to be accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>God the Son,</hi> which were to be reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and performed in their ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When he ſhall make his Soul an offering for ſin, he ſhall ſee his ſeed, he ſhall prolong his dayes, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand,</hi> Iſa. 53. 10. There is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſcribed, and the time prefixed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:123675:15"/> to be eternal, if we ſhall conſider how mightily <hi>Gods</hi> truth was ingaged in the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou ſhalt not eat of it: for in the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord,</hi> Gen. 2. 17.</p>
               <p>Yet we ſee that <hi>Adam</hi> did eat, and died not accordingly, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
               <p>Now how ſhall the truth of <hi>God</hi> be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in this caſe? but by vertue of ſome ſuch former act, as might diſ-ingage <hi>Gods</hi> reſolution, before it proceeded to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution? which in all probability, muſt be according to that eternal purpoſe, <hi>which he purpoſed in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> Eph. 3. 11.</p>
               <p>For albeit the truth of <hi>God</hi> might ſeem to ſuffer in the breach of the <hi>Covenant of works: yet grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> John 1. 17.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if we ſhall ſeriouſly regard the Juſtice of <hi>God,</hi> we ſhall finde this <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> to be eternal.</p>
               <p>Almighty <hi>God</hi> createth <hi>Adam,</hi> and freely gives him great poſſeſſions: reſerving to himſelf the fruit of one tree onely, in ſigne of homage due to his ſupremacy: And in caſe of diſobedience by eating thereof, he decrees the penalty of death. Nevertheleſſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:123675:16"/> 
                  <hi>Adam</hi> tranſgreſſeth in this very particular.</p>
               <p>And ſhall he eat, and not die? <hi>Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</hi> ſaith <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> Gen. 18. 25. But <hi>Adam</hi> eateth and dieth not.</p>
               <p>Now the juſtice of <hi>God,</hi> which muſt not, cannot be violated, ſends us of neceſſity to ſome further conſideration: There muſt be ſome preconcluſion made by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſſe, if <hi>Chriſt the Redeemer</hi> had not been ready by vertue of this <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> to ſatisfie <hi>Gods</hi> Juſtice, even in that very inſtant of mans rebellion againſt the <hi>Covenant of works:</hi> Death &amp; deſtruction had immediately ſeiſed upon ſinfull man, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the whole Creation: But in that very point of time, the <hi>Son of God</hi> appeareth in the preſence of his <hi>Father,</hi> on the behalf of miſerable man: Saying, <hi>Deliver him from going down to the pit; I have found a Ranſome,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> 33. 24. And in order thereunto: <hi>Chriſt ſuffered, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God,</hi> or reconcile us to <hi>God,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 18.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, if we look back towards <hi>Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection:</hi> that will alſo prove unto us the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of this Covenant. <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> (ſaith <hi>St.</hi> Paul) <hi>be the God, and father of the Lord</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:123675:16"/> 
                  <hi>Jeſus Chriſt: who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bleſſings in heavenly places in Chriſt: Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the World,</hi> Eph. 1. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>Now in all reaſon, there was no occaſion, why <hi>God</hi> ſhould chooſe any in <hi>Chriſt</hi> before the foundation of the world; but that, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing mans general ruine by his diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the <hi>Covenant of works,</hi> a remnant might be preſerved from deſtruction by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> according to the <hi>Election of Grace.</hi> And therefore moſt excellent to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is that of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothie. Be not thou therefore aſhamed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the teſtimony of our Lord, nor of me his priſoner, but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the Goſpel, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the power of God: who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our works; but according to his own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and grace, which was given us in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, before the World began,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 8, 9. Let us conſider the latter verſe more ſeriouſly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us:</hi> He ſaved us intentionally, before he called us actually: <hi>Not according to our works:</hi> or according to the Covenant of works made with us, <hi>but according to his own purpoſe and grace:</hi> or his own purpoſe in the <hi>Covenant of Grace: which was given us:</hi> in whom? why in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> when? <hi>before the world began.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:123675:17"/>
               <p> The certainty of all theſe former four par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars will appear yet more clearly, if we ſhall conceive, and conſider: That <hi>God the Father</hi> almighty, together with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> his onely begotten co-eſſential <hi>Son,</hi> did from eternity contrive to advance their glory, and to make it ſhine through their illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attributes of <hi>Goodneſſe, Power, Wiſdom, Juſtice, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to that purpoſe this individual two: the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> did in the unity of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> comply and conclude to model<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize, or frame a goodly creature called <hi>Man.</hi> Such a one as may be ſenſible of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions: capable of their commands; and active to proceed in their deſigns.</p>
               <p>The better to affect him with their <hi>good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:</hi> they will create him of contemptible materials: <hi>The duſt of the earth:</hi> But they will ſhape him in a royal mould: <hi>In their own Image.</hi> And leaſt he ſhould be wanting in any particular whatſoever: To manifeſt the greatneſſe of their <hi>power:</hi> They'll frame for him a ſpacious Univerſe: A World com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly, and abundantly ſupplied with all things neceſſary, convenient, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, far beyond humane apprehenſion: over all which <hi>Man</hi> ſhall have the ſole do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. To qualifie, and fit him for ſuch a
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:123675:17"/> vaſt command: They will inrich his perſon with excellent endowments, and his minde with admirable inſtructions. Nevertheleſſe (in reſervation of their own original right) they will binde him by <hi>Covenant</hi> to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of certain particulars: And in caſe of his diſobedience thereunto, they will caſt him from the height of honour, into the depth of horrour and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>But in their boundleſſe <hi>wiſdom</hi> they fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, that man, their great Vicegerent, will miſcarry, and fall away from his integrity. And therefore, in reference to their <hi>Juſtice,</hi> they can do no leſſe than confound and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him for ever, together with all thoſe excellent dignities and dominions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are reſolved to indow him.</p>
               <p>But leaſt, by this means, their glorie ſhould be buried in the untimely ruines of ſuch a promiſing fair enterpriſe. The <hi>Son</hi> ſupports it with the pillar of his <hi>grace:</hi> the Monument of a moſt dear <hi>Redeemer. Father</hi> (ſaith he) I will not undertake to keep the Rebel from his curſed fall, leaſt happily he boaſts himſelf to ſtand by his own ſtrength.</p>
               <p>But in his fall, I will keep him from the curſe: yet ſatisfie thy <hi>Juſtice</hi> to the full. Be pleaſed to deliver to my hand his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:123675:18"/> ſo forfeited: return him over debtour unto me, and leave him wholly to my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody: I'le be his ſurety.</p>
               <p>In the interim (O my <hi>Father)</hi> to magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the riches of our <hi>Grace:</hi> let thou and I contract a <hi>Covenant:</hi> A preventing Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, to take effect juſt at the very inſtant of his fall: wherein I'le riſe a <hi>Mediatour</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thy Juſtice and his weakneſſe: which if he, or any of his loſt poſterity, ſhall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly receive and ſeal unto: I will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſave him from thy wrath: but likewiſe I'le reſtore him to thy love, in which I will eſtabliſh him for ever.</p>
               <p>To this the <hi>Father</hi> gives his free conſent: And thus the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son</hi> conclude to ratifie this <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truely, I doubt not, but all ſuch as are truely godly will very well admit of this ſuppoſed conference, provided that it be with holy reverence.</p>
               <p>For we read: <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt through the eternal Spirit offered himſelf without ſpot to God,</hi> Hebr. 9. 14. And that <hi>God</hi> received him with this congratulation. <hi>In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have I helped thee: and I will preſerve thee, and give thee for a Covenant of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to eſtabliſh the earth, to cauſe to inherit the</hi>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:123675:18"/> 
                  <hi>deſolate heritages: That thou mayeſt ſay to the priſoners, go forth; to them that are in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſhew your ſelves: And they ſhall feed in wayes, and their paſtures ſhall be in all high places,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. 8, 9. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I beſeech you, let us take theſe words of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> unto <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> into our further conſideration.</p>
               <p>For verily we cannot conceive at the firſt view, how punctually they may be applied to that eternal <hi>Covenant. In an acceptable time have I heard thee</hi> on the worlds behalf: And <hi>I have helped thee</hi> to work ſalvation in a day, moſt proper for that purpoſe: <hi>And I will preſerve thee, and give thee for a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of</hi> (or concerning) <hi>the people,</hi> or on the behalf of the people) <hi>to eſtabliſh the earth:</hi> which otherwiſe would be deſtroyed: <hi>To cauſe to inherit the heritages:</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would be made deſolate. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> together with their whole poſterity, in them, ſhall be priſoners to my Juſtice. But thou ſhalt inlarge them: <hi>That thou mayeſt ſay to the priſoners: Go forth;</hi> they ſhall hide themſelves from my preſence, as in darkneſſe, but thou ſhalt make them confident, ſaying, <hi>ſhew your ſelves.</hi> And they ſhall live ſafely, pleaſantly, and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:123675:19"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>They ſhall feed in the wayes, and their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures ſhall be in all high places,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>By this concluſion, between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> their Creation is finiſhed &amp; furniſhed: Man, their great Governour is conſtituted by Commiſſion, and confirmed by <hi>Covenant:</hi> which he, rebelling, breaks, and tumbles headlong towards condemnation.</p>
               <p>But in that very point of time, the <hi>Son</hi> (by virtue of this <hi>Cov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nant of Grace)</hi> redeems him from deſtruction: Reſtores him to his <hi>Fathers</hi> favour: And re-eſtates him in his firſt Command. Where he, with all of his elect poſterity (perſiſting in the faith of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt)</hi> are mounted from the degree of ſervants, to the dignity of <hi>Sons:</hi> according to the Tenor of eternal truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God: even to them that believe on his name,</hi> John 1. 12.</p>
               <p>And thus we ſee, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works:</hi> According to that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Tit. 2. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to the words of our Text.</p>

               <p> PRoceed we now to the ſecond point, or Member contained in this Copy of the <hi>Covenant of Grace:</hi> Being the <hi>Conſideration,</hi> or motive that invited the <hi>Lord</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract this <hi>Covenant:</hi> which we finde to be his <hi>Love: God ſo loved the World: So loved:</hi> A vehement forcible expreſſion: <hi>So: So</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, <hi>So</hi> infinitely. Indeed, we may not conceive that any other, but an infinite <hi>Love</hi> ſhould proceed from an infinite <hi>God:</hi> For <hi>Love</hi> in <hi>God</hi> is not accidental, but eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial: And therefore it is attributed unto him in the abſtract by that beloved Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: <hi>God is Love</hi> (ſaith he) 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 8. Love it ſelf.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible for any creature ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to commend the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> becauſe we are not able to comprehend the <hi>love</hi> of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet we may commend it for <hi>a great love, wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in ſins.</hi> According to St. <hi>Pauls</hi> expreſſion, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 4. And according to the <hi>Lords</hi> own example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For God comemndeth his love towards us, in that, when we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us,</hi> Rom. 5. 8.</p>
               <p>Neither doth this commendation of the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> from the mouth of

               <p>
                  <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you will ſay: how doth it appear, that the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> was the onely <hi>Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> or motive that procured him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We muſt underſtand and conſider: That <hi>God</hi> being <hi>Love</hi> it ſelf: As having the very pure and perfect ſubſtance of love in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf eſſentially: He loveth himſelf by the neceſſity of his nature: And his Creatures by the liberty of his will.</p>
               <p>And ſo reſolving to create the World, with every particular therein contained; he looked on them with a general love, as being his good Creatures, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 31.</p>
               <p>But on man he looked with a more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar affection: Firſt, In reſpect, that man was the onely Creature, by whom the <hi>Lord</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to advance his own immortal glory, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 7.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For that the <hi>Lord</hi> intended to create him in his own <hi>Image:</hi> As well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſubſtance of his Soul, being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal and immaterial, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. As alſo in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:123675:20"/> regard of the perfections of his Soul, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of <hi>Righteouſneſſe and true Holineſſe, Eph.</hi> 4. 24.</p>
               <p>But then foreſeeing mans accurſed fall, procured wholly by his own default: The <hi>God</hi> of goodneſſe looks upon him, then even, with the love of pity and compaſſion: which ſo prevailed in his <hi>Son Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> That, <hi>He gave himſelf for us, an offering, and a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour,</hi> Eph. 5. 2.

               <p>Which ſo increaſed and confirm'd his love: that he concludes this <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And certainly (there being no poſſibility to be expected from decayed mankinde for the repairing of themſelves, either by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, ſatisfaction, interceſſion, or any other way, or means whatſoever) we muſt needs conceive, conſider, and aſſure our Souls: That whatſoever <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>God</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> his ſake, either did, do, or ſhall do, in order unto <hi>Mans</hi> ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or whatſoever elſe may truely be called a bleſſing; They did, do, and ſhall do it, meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by virtue of that undeſerved <hi>Love,</hi> which they vouchſafed in this <hi>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Had not that prevailed, man had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed:
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:123675:21"/> and <hi>God</hi> had loſt the glory of his grace, which ſhines moſt clearly through mans <hi>Redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Without doubt, it is in reference to this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <hi>Covenant;</hi> That our <hi>Redemption</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>eternal;</hi> Hebr. 9. 12. our <hi>Salvation eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;</hi> Hebr. 5. 9.</p>
               <p>And our <hi>Inheritance eternal,</hi> Hebr. 9. 15.</p>
               <p>And the onely <hi>Conſideration,</hi> or Motive, that procured all this, was <hi>Gods eternal,</hi> or <hi>everlaſting Love, wherewith he loved us,</hi> Jer. 31. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He loved</hi> us generally as his Creatures: <hi>He loved</hi> us particularly as thoſe Creatures, by whom he intended chiefly to advance his glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He loved</hi> us more eſpecially, as bearing his own <hi>Image. He loved</hi> us compaſſionately, as foreſeeing our fall in <hi>Adam</hi> our old Grand-Father.</p>
               <p>But <hi>he loved</hi> us moſt effectually upon the interceſſion of <hi>Chriſt</hi> his own <hi>dear Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus <hi>God ſo loved the World.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, What manner of <hi>Son</hi> he was.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, How, and to what purpoſe <hi>God</hi> did ſo aſſign him.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, be pleaſed to remember what I have formerly delivered concerning this Precontract.</p>
               <p>How <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father,</hi> and his bleſſed <hi>Son</hi> fore-ſeeing mans deſtruction by his fall: Leaſt by that means their purpoſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Creation ſhould miſcarrie: The <hi>Son Chriſt Jeſus</hi> gives himſelf to <hi>God</hi> a ſurety for the Creature: And in caſe of mans default, to ſatisfie the law on mans behalf. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Lord</hi> returns his <hi>Son</hi> by deſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion debtour to the law: which he muſt to the uttermoſt diſcharge, by ſuffering death, which man of right muſt ſuffer. Not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, for yet there was no cauſe, why he ſhould anſwer what was yet undone: Nor at
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:123675:22"/> the very inſtant of mans fall: The <hi>Lord</hi> was pleaſed to take his ſingle Bond: And to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the execution, untill his own appointed time ſhould come.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, by virtue of this <hi>Covenant, God</hi> gave his <hi>Son</hi> for mans Redemption in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally, and by way of preordination before all time, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 19. effectually in the beginning of time, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8. And actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the fulneſſe of time, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 4. Now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit theſe ſeveral times were farre diſtant the one from the other in our apprehenſion: Yet they were not ſo in <hi>Gods</hi> repute and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation: for with him all times are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: <hi>Eternity is evermore Gods preſent Tenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus it may appear, that the <hi>Gift,</hi> which <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> gave in this eternal <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> was his <hi>onely begotten Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that he then gave him, not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally according to our diſcretion: But effectually and actually according to his own purpoſe and ſatisfaction. Moreover, if we conſider the occaſion, why <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> did make this <hi>Covenant:</hi> Namely, to ſave man from that wofull curſe, which he did voluntarily incurre.</p>
               <p>And yet to clear <hi>Gods</hi> Juſtice ſo ingaged, us in the <hi>Covenant of works.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:123675:22"/>
               <p> Then we ſhall finde, that nothing could avail to bring to paſſe that intricate deſigne, but the onely <hi>Son of God,</hi> both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gods</hi> Juſtice ſeiſeth upon every ſin: from which, nor men, nor Angels were quite free, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 9. and <hi>Job</hi> 4. 18. And none but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>God</hi> might ſtay <hi>Gods</hi> hand. But man hath ſinned, and man muſt ſuffer for't. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Mans</hi> Nature <hi>Chriſt</hi> muſt die: and <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> muſt ſatisfie <hi>Gods</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated Juſtice.</p>
               <p>And very punctual to this purpoſe is that of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto us a childe is born, unto us a ſon is given, and the government ſhall be upon his ſhoulder: and his Name ſhall be called wonderfull, Counſeller, The mighty God, The everlaſting Father, The Prince of peace,</hi> Iſa. 9. 6. Theſe glorious expreſſions were too high for any, but the eternal <hi>Son of God:</hi> who was then, or at that time, neither born, nor given, otherwiſe then by way of promiſe and prevention: And that by this eternal <hi>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that we may be the more ſenſible of that incomparable <hi>Love,</hi> which Almighty <hi>God</hi> vouchſafed us in this moſt precious <hi>Gift:</hi> Let us conſider, for what kinde of <hi>Son,</hi> the word of truth hath ſet him forth unto us.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:123675:23"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>He is Gods own Son,</hi> Rom. 8. 32. <hi>His onely begotten Son, which is in the boſome of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> John 1. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His beloved Son, in whom he is well pleaſed,</hi> Mat. 17. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His dear Son, or the Son of his Love,</hi> Col. 1. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whom he hath appointed heir of all things,</hi> Heb. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In whom his Soul delighteth,</hi> Iſa. 42. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who never diſpleaſed him,</hi> John 8. 29.</p>
               <p>Did <hi>God</hi> give this near, dear, delightfull <hi>Son</hi> of his, to ſuffer death, a curſed death, to ſave accurſed rebels from deſtruction? True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the though thereof (if any thing ſerious) will inforce us to conclude with that belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Diſciple: <hi>Herein is Love</hi> (the very power, efficacy, and excellency of Love) <hi>Not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 John 4. 10.</p>
               <p>But happily 't will be demanded, how, and to what purpoſe did <hi>God</hi> give his <hi>Son</hi> in this eternal <hi>Covenant of Grace?</hi> I anſwer thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God,</hi> being ſimply and eſſentially one, conſidering mans eternal ſeparation, both from his preſence, and his favour too, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by mans rebellion. The ſame one <hi>God</hi> did graciouſly decree, to take upon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:123675:23"/> him in the Perſon of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the Name, and Nature of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Man:</hi> By that myſterious meanes to reconcile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde unto himſelf. And thus as <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> in his Juſtice oppoſeth mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, ſo <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> in mercie intercedes, and pacifies <hi>Gods</hi> wrath for <hi>Mans</hi> offence.</p>
               <p>And therefore very much to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul. There is one God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and one Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus: who gave himſelf a Ranſome for all to be te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in due time,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>In which words I deſire you to conſider: Firſt, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>Mediatour</hi> gave <hi>Himſelf a Ranſome:</hi> Not ſilver, nor gold, nor ſuch corruptible traſh, but himſelf: Secondly, that he gave himſelf <hi>a Ranſome for all:</hi> Not onely for <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>John;</hi> and thoſe that followed him in the fleſh: But alſo for <hi>Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah,</hi> and all that through the like faith either did, do, or ſhall imbrace him in the ſpirit: and thirdly, that this was not teſtified, or revealed ſo ſoon as it was concluded: <hi>but to be teſtified in due time.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By which (me thinkes) it doth appear moſt plain: that <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>Mediatour,</hi> firſt did give himſelf to <hi>God</hi> by this eternal <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:123675:24"/> a Ranſome and Redemption for Mankinde: whom <hi>God</hi> receiving in full ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: Gives him again. <hi>To ſuffer for ſin,</hi> Iſa. 53. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To juſtifie the ungodly,</hi> Rom. 4. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To fulfill the Law for every one that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth,</hi> Rom. 10. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To be the object of our faith,</hi> Joh. 6. 29.</p>
               <p>The onely object of our faith: <hi>For there is none other name under Heaven given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, whereby we muſt be ſaved,</hi> Acts 4. 12.</p>
               <p>And finally and eternally to be whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is good, and profitable for the children of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I have given him for a witneſſe to the people: a Leader, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander to the people,</hi> Iſa. 55. 4. For a <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> to teſtifie unto the people, that all the <hi>promiſes of God in him are; yea, and Amen.</hi> According to that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Leader:</hi> to lead them to the <hi>Father</hi> in the way of truth, and life: <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>no man co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth unto the father, but by me,</hi> John 14. 6. <hi>And a Commander to the people:</hi> To work powerfully upon their hearts. <hi>He taught them as one that had authority, and not as the</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:123675:24"/> 
                  <hi>Scribes,</hi> ſaith the Evangeliſt, <hi>Marc.</hi> 1. 22. He ſaid unto <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> his brother: <hi>Follow me, And they ſtraightway followed him,</hi> Mat. 4. 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>They immediately obey his Command without any inquiſition, either concerning profit, or preferment: Such <hi>Queries</hi> as are much inſiſted upon by unconfirmed reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He is made unto us of God wiſdom, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. Are you ignorant? <hi>Chriſt</hi> is your <hi>wiſdom:</hi> Are you ſinfull? <hi>He is your ſanctification:</hi> Are you inthralled, or diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, or any way afflicted? <hi>He is your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or do you fear, that you ſhall want any thing, that may concern either your being, or your well-being? <hi>Why all things are yours: whether</hi> Paul, <hi>or</hi> Apollo, <hi>or</hi> Cephas, <hi>or the World, or life, or death, or things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or things, to come, all are yours. And ye are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 21, 22, 23. If <hi>Chriſt</hi> once comes to own you: ye ſhall have his <hi>Miniſters</hi> to inſtruct, and to edifie you: The <hi>World</hi> ſhall not harm you: <hi>your life</hi> ſhall be gain, and your <hi>Death</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: <hi>Things preſent</hi> ſhall content you: And <hi>things to come</hi> ſhall comfort you. <hi>All things are yours.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:123675:25"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>We know</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) that all things work together for good to them that love God: to them who are the called, according to his purpoſe,</hi> Rom. 8. 28. According to his eternal purpoſe in this eternal <hi>Covenant.</hi> Nor do ye doubt of this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For he that ſpared not his own Son, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him up for us all: how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things,</hi> Rom. 8. 32. You may haply conceive, that your loſſe by <hi>Adam</hi> was very great: But truely you may be confident, that your gain by <hi>Chriſt</hi> is infinitely greater. For though <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency enjoyed the riches of <hi>Gods goodneſſe:</hi> yet he was not then ſenſible of the exceeding riches of his <hi>Grace. For grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> John 1. 17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whatſoever <hi>Adam</hi> then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from <hi>God,</hi> he received it onely as a ſervant: <hi>But as many as receive the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; to them he giveth power to become the ſons of God,</hi> John 1. 12.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, Though <hi>Adam</hi> in his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency was a righteous perſon: Yet, being left to his own power, he fell into condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But there is now no condemnation to them, that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8. 1.</p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:123675:25"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>For they are kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation,</hi> ſaith another A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p>And this our <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf confirmeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My ſheep</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: And I give unto them eternal life, and they ſhall never pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, neither ſhall any man pluck them out of my hand,</hi> John 10. 27, 28.</p>
               <p>Thus have I ſhown you in the explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the third point: Firſt, that the gift conveyed in this eternal <hi>Covenant</hi> was <hi>Chriſt, the onely begotten ſon of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I have ſhown you for what manner of <hi>Son</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> ſets him forth.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, How, and for what purpoſe the <hi>Father</hi> did give, and ſend him. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to ſuffer for ſin. To juſtifie the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, To fulfill the Law for all believers. To be the onely object of our faith. And to be all good things to all good Chriſtians: To all that believe in him: According to the <hi>proviſo,</hi> or condition expreſſed and required in this <hi>Covenant of Grace:</hi> which by the fourth and next branch contained in this Copy appeareth to be <hi>faith. That whoſoever believeth in him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his</hi>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:123675:26"/> 
                  <hi>onely begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>JN this fourth point, or Member we ſhall conſider theſe three particulars: Firſt, What is intended by this word <hi>Believe:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Why <hi>God</hi> requreth <hi>faith</hi> for the <hi>proviſo,</hi> or condition of this <hi>Covenant:</hi> And thirdly, Why he requireth nothing but <hi>faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the firſt, we muſt know, that this word <hi>believe:</hi> implieth much more then it ſeemeth to expreſſe.</p>
               <p>But in as much as it hath relation to the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>promiſes of God:</hi> wherein his <hi>Son</hi> is holden forth unto us: It doth properly ſignifie <hi>faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this <hi>faith</hi> conſiſteth of two parts: that is to ſay, <hi>Aſſent</hi> and <hi>Conſent,</hi> whereof the firſt is an Act of the underſting: The ſecond an Act of the will.</p>
               <p>In the firſt, the judgement is convinced to acknowledge and profeſſe. In the ſecond, the will is diſpoſed to imbrace and practice. Nevertheleſſe, this <hi>Aſſent</hi> by it ſelf, is often taken for a general <hi>faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it hath theſe three degrees: <hi>Opinion, knowledge,</hi> and <hi>aſſurance.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:123675:26"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Opinion</hi> is, when a man believeth a thing to be true according to his preſent appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and judgement: Yet the ſame thing may be otherwiſe, for ought that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: Or when a man verily thinks the thing to be true, which may afterwards appear to be contrary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I verily thought with my ſelf</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth: <hi>which thing I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did in Jeruſalem, and many of the Saints did I ſhut up in priſon.</hi> And ſo he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to recount in what horrible practices that erronious <hi>Opinion</hi> of his had engaged him, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>The ſecond degree is <hi>knowledge:</hi> when a mans judgement is ſo far convinced, either by reaſon, or by ſome powerfull argument: that his knowledge is confirmed in the thing, whereof he was formerly ſomewhat uncertain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rabbi</hi> (ſaith <hi>Nichodemus) we know that thou art a Teacher come from God: for no man can do theſe miracles that thou doeſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept God be with him,</hi> John. 3. 2.</p>
               <p>The third is <hi>Aſſurance:</hi> And this is, when a man becometh confident in the thing that he thinks, and knows, in regard of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible authority of the Authour thereof.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:123675:27"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Lord</hi> (ſaith the Centurion) <hi>I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, that thou ſhouldeſt come under my roof: But ſpeak the word onely, and my ſervant ſhall be healed,</hi> Math. 8. 8. And thus the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let us hold faſt the profeſſion of our faith without wavering (for he is faithfull that promiſed,</hi> Hebr. 10. 23. By theſe three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees this <hi>Aſſent</hi> amounteth to the nature of a general <hi>faith.</hi> And as this general faith hath ſeveral degrees: So there are likewiſe divers kindes of <hi>faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As firſt, there is a miraculous <hi>faith:</hi> or a faith inabling men to work miracles.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verily I ſay unto you: If ye have faith, as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, ye ſhall ſay unto this mountain, remove hence to yonder place: and it ſhall remove, and nothing ſhall be unpoſſible unto you,</hi> ſaith our <hi>Saviour</hi> to his Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 20.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Faith. Now the ſpirit ſpeaketh expreſly that in the latter times ſome ſhall depart from the faith, giving heed to ſeducing ſpirits and Doctrines of Devils,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 1. where the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> is oppoſed to the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Devils.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is an <hi>Hiſtorical faith, King Agrippa believeſt thou the Prophets? I</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:123675:27"/> 
                  <hi>know that thou believeſt,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> 26, 27.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, there is a Temporary <hi>faith:</hi> Intimated unto us in the ſtony ground, <hi>which for a while believe, and in time of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation fall away,</hi> Luke 8. 13.</p>
               <p>But the moſt conſiderable is a <hi>juſtifying,</hi> and a <hi>ſaving faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Knowing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt: even we have believed in Jeſus Chriſt, that we might he juſtified by the faith of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2. 16.</p>
               <p>And thus the <hi>Saviour</hi> to the ſinfull wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: <hi>Thy faith hath ſaved thee: go in peace,</hi> Luke 7. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt two kinds of <hi>faith:</hi> Namely the miraculous <hi>faith,</hi> and the <hi>Doctrine of faith,</hi> were common to the Reprobate, as well as to the true <hi>believer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For firſt, we read that the miraculous faith was given to <hi>Judas</hi> the Traitour, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the reſt of the Diſciples, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. to the 9.</p>
               <p>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ſecondly, we finde that <hi>Himeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> did ſometimes incline to the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith: But they put it away:</hi> And therefore St. Paul <hi>delivered them to Satan,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 19, 20.</p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:123675:28"/>
               <p> The third, being the <hi>Hiſtorical Faith,</hi> is not onely uſed, or rather abuſed by the Reprobate, but even by the Devils alſo. <hi>Thou believeſt that there is one God, thou doeſt well: the Devils alſo believe and tremble,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James,</hi> James 2. 19.</p>
               <p>The fourth kinde, which is the <hi>Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faith,</hi> is likewiſe proper to the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate: we read that <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer (whom we call <hi>Simon Magus) believed and was baptized,</hi> Acts 8. 13.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, not long after, <hi>Simon Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> tells him, <hi>That he perceives him to be in the gaul of bitterneſſe, and the bond of iniquity,</hi> Acts 8. 23.</p>
               <p>But the fifth, and laſt kinde, which is the <hi>juſtifying</hi> and the <hi>ſaving faith,</hi> is peculiar onely to the Children of <hi>God. Ye are all the Children of God by faith in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3. 26.</p>
               <p>For by this kind of <hi>faith</hi> we are inabled, not onely by <hi>Aſſent</hi> to believe the Promiſes, but alſo by <hi>conſent</hi> to imbrace them. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13.</p>
               <p>Now the want of knowledge, and ability to diſtinguiſh rightly of theſe ſeveral kindes of <hi>faith,</hi> preſented unto us in the word of <hi>God,</hi> under the general notion of <hi>faith:</hi> is one main occaſion of many dangerous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, now promoted amongſt us.</p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:123675:28"/>
               <p> For firſt, the miraculous <hi>faith</hi> is unſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable.</p>
               <p>For albeit it was neceſſary in the infancy of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or at the firſt preaching, or planting thereof: to manifeſt that it was altogether of <hi>God:</hi> To which purpoſe the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> in his firſt Commiſſions to the twelve, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 1, 2. And likewiſe to the ſeventy, <hi>Luke</hi> 10, 9. did impower them to work miracles, as well as to preach. Yet in the greater perfection of the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> when the <hi>Saviour</hi> had ſealed it with his bloud. In his laſt Commiſſion to his Diſciples (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he promiſeth) <hi>To be with them alway, even unto the end of the World,</hi> Math. 28. 19, 20. He makes there no mention at all of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay: There were many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles wrought after <hi>Chriſts</hi> Aſcention; True.</p>
               <p>Yet I finde nothing to confirm me, that they were wrought by any other, then ſome, or one of the former twelve, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty, or ſome ſuch as the <hi>Lord</hi> was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to impower perſonally to that purpoſe: as being the firſt, and chief planters, and propagatours of his Goſpel. For I do not read that he promiſed that power to ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:123675:29"/>
               <p> This I argue to inform the ignorance of ſuch of our <hi>Proteſtant profeſſion,</hi> as do ſay, or think, that they cannot attain to any meaſure of true <hi>faith.</hi> For if we had (will ſome ſay) as much thereof as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, we ſhoud be able to remove mountains. But this is one great miſtake ariſing from the miſapprehenſion of the word <hi>faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Doctrine of faith</hi> is decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: It may be both declined, ſlighted, and deſerted: A man may both fail in it, and fall from it: like thoſe fooliſh <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> reproved for that very offence, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. to the 6. verſe.</p>
               <p>But though it may be declined, ſlighted, and deſerted: yet it cannot be wreſted, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified, or corrupted: for ſo the very nature thereof is deſtroyed: And inſtead of the <hi>Doctrine of faith,</hi> it becometh the Doctrine of Devils.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Hiſtorical faith</hi> is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible: It may be corrupted, depraved, and prophaned; as it is oftentimes by ſuch as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to countenance, or excuſe their own abominations, by the Hiſtories of the Saints infirmities.</p>
               <p>As their drunkenneſſe by <hi>Noahs</hi> igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or weakneſſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 21.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:123675:29"/>
               <p> Their Adultery by <hi>Davids</hi> over-ſight, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>Their Perjuries by <hi>Peters</hi> denial, Matth. 26. 72.</p>
               <p>Their impenitence, or procraſtination by the good thiefs laſt hours ſucceſſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 43. and the like. Abuſing ſuch Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as might ſerve to confirm their faith in the mercies of their <hi>Saviour:</hi> by making them ſerviceable to Satan, <hi>wreſting them to their own deſtruction,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 16.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Temporary faith</hi> is unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, cowardly, and contemptible.</p>
               <p>For we read of many in great authority that believed on the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> but they were frighted from their profeſſion, <hi>John</hi> 12. 42. And the reaſon is annexed. <hi>For they loved the praiſe of men, more then the praiſe of God,</hi> verſe 43.</p>
               <p>Now, from the miſtaking of theſe, or any of theſe infirm kindes of <hi>faith:</hi> inſtead of the true <hi>juſtifying and ſaving faith:</hi> ſeveral errours have received their original, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that uncomfortable errour of the Saints falling from <hi>Grace</hi> received through the unſteadfaſtneſſe of their <hi>faith.</hi> But I dare be bold to affirm that ſuch Apoſtates did never feel the force of an effectual <hi>faith:</hi> of a juſtifying <hi>faith.</hi> This is <hi>the gift of God,</hi> Rom. 12. 3.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:123675:30"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>And the gifts, and calling of God are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance,</hi> Rom. 11. 29.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay, but a man may fall grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly in it: but he can never fall finally from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Lord hath ſaid: I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee,</hi> Heb. 13. 5.</p>
               <p>And truely, I conceive, this diſcovery to be very pertinent to our preſent purpoſe: For <hi>faith</hi> being the onely <hi>condition</hi> to be performed by us in this <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> It is very neceſſary, that we be rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed therein: Leaſt peradventure we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſatisfie our ſelves with empty ſhadows inſtead of the true ſubſtance. Or torment our ſelves with cauſeleſſe diſcomforts, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the loſſe, or uncertainty of that glorious inheritance, which our gracious <hi>God</hi> by the purchaſe of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> hath ſo long ſince eſtated upon a true, and a lively <hi>faith,</hi> according to this eternal Covenant.</p>
               <p>We proceed now to conſider, why the <hi>Lord</hi> propoundeth <hi>faith</hi> for the <hi>Proviſo,</hi> or Condition of this <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt (I conceive) becauſe he would have his <hi>gift</hi> received, which would otherwiſe become fruitleſſe, and unprofitable: He gave <hi>his onely begotten Son;</hi> And were it not a world of pitie that ſuch a precious gift
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:123675:30"/> ſhould be neglected; and not received, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and improved? Well, how are we to receive him? Into our houſes? No, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hearts.</p>
               <p>By what inſtrument, or means? Verily, by faith onely: According to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By faith Chriſt liveth in us,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. <hi>And by faith Chriſt dwelleth in us: in our hearts,</hi> Eph. 3. 17.</p>
               <p>Queſtionleſſe, there is no relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Saviour</hi> and the ſouls of his Saints, but what is contracted, fixed, and confirmed by his <hi>affection,</hi> and their lively <hi>faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Lord</hi> requireth <hi>faith:</hi> That ſo this <hi>gift</hi> of his might be beneficial to the whole World in all places, and at all times indifferently.</p>
               <p>For were <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be received any other way then: by <hi>faith:</hi> All men could not have been capable of receiving him at all ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe he had come into the World in the day of the Creation: and continued in the World till the day of diſſolution. Yet in regard of his paſſive Nature; his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; he could not have been received by any two perſons in any two ſeveral places at one and the ſame time.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:123675:31"/>
               <p> But whereſoever he abideth <hi>faith</hi> will inſtantly finde him out, and lay hold upon him.</p>
               <p>And therefore there is no cauſe now, why any man ſhould ſay in his heart: <hi>who ſhall aſcend into Heaven? that is to bring down Chriſt from above, or who ſhall deſcend into the deep? that is, to bring up Chriſt from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart; that is the word of faith, which we preach,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 10. 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>And this word of <hi>faith,</hi> which we preach (if truely believed, and rightly applied) will do both: It will bring down <hi>Chriſt</hi> from above, with the virtue of his Reſurrection and Aſcention. And it will bring up <hi>Chriſt</hi> from beneath, with the virtue of his death and paſſion. It will do all things that may concern the Remiſſion of our ſins: the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our perſons: and the ſalvation of our Souls, by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>So then</hi> (ſaith the ſame Apoſtle in the ſame Chapter) <hi>faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. But I ſay, have they not heard? Yes, verily their ſound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world,</hi> Rom. 10. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>And to that very purpoſe the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:123675:31"/> 
                  <hi>Chriſt,</hi> after his Reſurrection gives his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles this univerſal Commiſſion: <hi>Go ye ſaith he, into all the world, and preach the Goſpel unto ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ry Creature:</hi> Well what is the tenour, or ſubſtance of that <hi>Goſpel? He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved:</hi> That is, he that receiveth <hi>Chriſt by faith,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſteth the ſame in his Profeſſion ſhall be ſaved, (as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10.) <hi>he that believeth not ſhall be damned,</hi> Marc. 16. 15, 16. And as this Goſpel; this word of <hi>faith</hi> is univerſal, ſo is it likewiſe everlaſting.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I ſaw another Angel fly in the midſt of heaven, having the everlaſting Coſpel, to preach unto them that dwell on the earth; and to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nation, and kindred, and tongue, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John,</hi> Rev. 14. 6.</p>
               <p>But why doth <hi>God</hi> require nothing elſe, but <hi>faith?</hi> We know there may be divers <hi>Proviſoes</hi> in one, and the ſame Conveyance, or <hi>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truely, <hi>faith</hi> by it ſelf is enough, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that it be ſuch a <hi>faith</hi> as apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that hath the Son, hath life,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>John,</hi> 1 John 5. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Col. 1. 19.</p>
               <p>Whatſoever had been required beſides
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:123675:32"/> 
                  <hi>faith</hi> (according to our apprehenſion) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it muſt have proceeded from, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon our own perſons or performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And then it is more then probable, that our corrupt nature would have miſlead us to neglect this all-ſatisfying <hi>gift:</hi> &amp; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelves, either wholly, or partly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our own deſerts, or abilities. But <hi>faith</hi> comes empty-handed, and by that means it takes the ſurer hold.</p>
               <p>When a man gives liberally, we ſay he is open-handed. And truely, he that will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive freely, and hold firmly, it is neceſſary that he be empty-handed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> is very fitly called the hand of the Soul: For as we uſe to receive an earthly gift from man by the hand: ſo we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this heavenly treaſure from <hi>God</hi> by <hi>faith.</hi> And therefore the Evangeliſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to this moſt bleſſed <hi>gift,</hi> intimateth unto us, that receiving, and believing do ſignifie the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As many as received him</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to them gave he power to become the ſons of God: even to ſoem that believe on his name,</hi> John 1. 12.</p>
               <p>A place very well worthy of our conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, for the proof of this particular.</p>
               <p>Verily this <hi>onely begotten Son of God,</hi> is beyond all thought of exception, the moſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:123675:32"/> ſatisfying, ſolid, and ſubſtantial gift: the moſt compleat and weighty gift, that either heaven, or earth can poſſibly afford us. And therefore whatſoever we have, or ſeem to have of our own, whether it be work, or worthineſſe: ſuffering, or ſatisfaction, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, or poſſibility: our <hi>faith</hi> muſt caſt it wholly to the ground, or otherwiſe we ſhall never receive the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> ſo, as to make him our own for ever.</p>
               <p>A ſecond Reaſon (which I conceive to be moſt proper in this caſe) is this. Becauſe whatſoever had been required with, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>faith.</hi> It would have been deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of the very nature of <hi>this Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For if by grace, then it is no more of works, otherwiſe grace is no more grace,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 11. 6.</p>
               <p>It is the nature of grace to be free, <hi>we are juſtified freely by his grace,</hi> ſaith the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24.</p>
               <p>If we ſhall look upon <hi>Gods</hi> words and works, we ſhall finde, that it is the will of <hi>God</hi> to give us his <hi>onely begotten Son Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> together with all his benefits, and bleſſings altogether freely, without <hi>coſt:</hi> without <hi>deſert,</hi> without <hi>aſſiſtance,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>ſeeking.</hi> Firſt, without our <hi>coſt,</hi> or charge.</p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:123675:33"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Thou haſt not brought me the ſmall cattel of thy burnt-offerings, neither haſt thou honoured me with thy ſacrifices: I have not cauſed thee to ſerve with an offering, nor wearied thee with Incenſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou haſt bought me no ſweet Cane with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, neither haſt thou filled me with the fat of thy ſacrifices: but thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins, thou haſt wearied me with thine iniquities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions for mine own ſake, and will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy ſins,</hi> ſaith <hi>the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 43. 23, 24, 25.</p>
               <p>Now this obliteration, or remiſſion of ſins is part of <hi>Chriſts</hi> purchaſe: and we cannot receive the one without the other. No <hi>Chriſt,</hi> no forgiveneſſe of ſins.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In him we have redemption through his bloud, even the forgiveneſſe of ſins,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph. 1. 7.</p>
               <p>Neither did <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf ſet his own graces to ſale, when he ſtood &amp; cried, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come unto me, and drink: he that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow Rivers of living water.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>We our ſelves alſo were ſometimes fooliſh, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, deceived, ſerving divers luſts and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, living in malice and envy, hatefull, and hating one another But after that the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared: Not by works of righteouſneſſe, which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the holy Ghoſt: which he ſhed on us abundantly, through Jeſus Chriſt our Saviour,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Tit. 3. 3. 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p>And to the <hi>Epheſians: God, who is rich in mercie, for his great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in ſins, hath quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us together with Chriſt (by grace ye are ſaved.)</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in the ages to come he might ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindneſſe towards us in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Eph. 2. 4. 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>All this he did for us, when we were dead in ſins. And alas! what can ſinfull dead men deſerve?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, he vouchſafeth us his <hi>Son Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> with all his graces and bleſſings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our aſſiſtance.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:123675:34"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>For if by one mans offence death reigned by one: much more they, which receive abundance of grace, and the gift of righteouſneſſe, ſhall reign in life by one</hi> Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore as by the offence of one, judgement came upon all men to condemnation; even ſo by the righteouſneſſe of one, the free gift came upon all men unto juſtification of life,</hi> Rom. 5. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>And if freely and meerly by one, then without our <hi>Aſſiſtance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, <hi>God</hi> gives us <hi>Chriſt</hi> without our <hi>ſeeking. When we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty, that we ſhould deſire him: He is deſpiſed and rejected of men, a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid our faces, as it were from him, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, and we eſteemed him not,</hi> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 2, 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The loſt ſheep ſought not the Shepheard; but the Shepheard ſought his loſt ſheep,</hi> Luke 15. 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am found of him that ſought me not,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>Redeemer,</hi> Iſa. 65. 1.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, that it is the nature of <hi>grace</hi> to give altoger freely.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace,</hi> Rom. 4. 16. <hi>For to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt,</hi> Rom. 4. 4.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:123675:34"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>By grace are ye ſaved through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God,</hi> Eph. 2. 8.</p>
               <p>And this I conceive to be a ſecond, and a ſolid reaſon, why <hi>God</hi> requireth nothing but <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Becauſe whatſoever had been required with, or beſides <hi>Faith,</hi> it would have been deſtructive to the very nature of this <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</hi>

               <p>THe fifth branch growing in this Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe: this <hi>Eden</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, is the prevention; freedom from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſhould not periſh, ſhould not be deſtroyed: I conceive, it will not be denied by any ſound Chriſtian, but that <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion againſt the <hi>Covenant of works</hi> did draw an univerſal guilt, and puniſhment over the face of the whole earth: Inſomuch that every man &amp; woman proceeding from <hi>Adam,</hi> after a natural generation is become guilty of his ſin, and by that means liable to his penalty.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we are all polluted by his ſinne: <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> Job 14. 4.</p>

               <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us: <hi>That the children of God by grace, were the children of wrath by nature,</hi> Eph. 2. 3.</p>
               <p>And it is onely ſin that ſubjecteth us to <hi>Gods</hi> wrath, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, as <hi>Adams</hi> corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ingaged us in his damnable ſin: ſo hath his ſin likewiſe expoſed us to his deadly puniſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For as by one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin: ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned,</hi> or in whom all have ſinned, ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 5. 12.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, that the contagion, or the infection of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin: and likewiſe the certainty of his puniſhment are both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come univerſal.</p>
               <p>And therefore this Hereditary corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath put us into a periſhing conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, although we had no ſin of our own to anſwer for. But then, if we ſhall conſider all our ſins, both original and actual: our ſins of omiſſion, and our ſins of commiſſion, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their ſeveral circumſtances and aggravations.</p>
               <p>Who can forbear to cry out with Saint <hi>Paul?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:123675:35"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>O wretched man that I am: who ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver me from the body of this death,</hi> Rom. 7. 24.</p>
               <p>The body of this death, or the power of this death. And verily we ſhall perceive the power of this death to be far more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, then ordinarily it is conceived to be: If we ſhall conſider it according to the ſeveral ſorts, or degrees of death: Which we finde to be four, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſpiritual death: the cordial death, the natural death, and the eternal death.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſpiritual death</hi> is that, whereby we are ſaid to be <hi>dead in ſin,</hi> Eph. 2. 1.</p>
               <p>And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us: <hi>The wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow that liveth in pleaſure is dead while ſhe liveth,</hi> 1 Tim. 5. 6. And thus the <hi>Spirit</hi> to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Sardis: Thou haſt a name that thou liveſt, and art dead,</hi> Rev. 3. 1.</p>
               <p>The <hi>cordial death</hi> (if I may ſo call it) or the death of the heart, is that which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth upon the ſenſe, or apprehenſion of ſome extream danger, or diſtreſſe: when diſcreet <hi>Abigail</hi> had told her husband <hi>Nabal</hi> of the danger he was in, by reaſon of his churliſh behaviour towards <hi>Davids</hi> young men: The Text ſaith, <hi>That his heart died within him, and he became as a ſtone,</hi> 1 Sam. 25. 37.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:123675:36"/>
               <p> And <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in the plague of locuſts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired <hi>Moſes and Aaron</hi> to intreat the <hi>Lord,</hi> that he might <hi>take away that death onely,</hi> Exod. 10. 17.</p>
               <p>The <hi>natural death</hi> conſiſteth in the diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of nature, or the ſeparation between the body and the Soul: It is ſaid, <hi>That when</hi> Rachels <hi>Soul departed, ſhe died,</hi> Gen. 35. 18.</p>
               <p>And when the widow of <hi>Zarephaths</hi> ſon was dead, <hi>Elijah cried unto the Lord, and ſaid, O Lord, my God, I pray thee, let this Childes Soul come into him again. And the Lord heard the voice of</hi> Elijah, <hi>and the Soul of the Childe came into him again, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived,</hi> 1 King. 17. 21, 22.</p>
               <p>The laſt is eternal death, conſiſting in thoſe eternal torments, which the damned ſhall be caſt into upon that peremptory ſentence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> Mat. 25. 41.</p>
               <p>In theſe four ſorts, or degrees of death, are comprehended all the diſcomforts, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchiefs, and miſeries, that mankinde can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, or ſuſpect: whether they be ſpiritual, temporal, or eternal: And now I ſhall prove that every one of them is the reward, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſin.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the ſpiritual death is the reward of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:123675:36"/> ſin: <hi>Becauſe that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkned: profeſſing themſelves to be wiſe, they became fools: And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God, into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and to four-footed beaſts, and creeping things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore God alſo gave them up to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, through the luſts of their own hearts, to diſhonour their own bodies between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> Rom. 1. 21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>For this cauſe God gave them up to vile affections,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſe</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>cordial death,</hi> or the death of affliction, trouble, and diſtreſſe: that is alſo the reward, or the puniſhment of ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We grope for the wall like the blinde, and we grope as if we had no eyes, we ſtumble at noon day as in the night, we are in deſolate places as dead men. We roar all like bears, and mourn ſore like doves: we look for judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but there is none: for ſalvation, but it is far off from us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For our tranſgreſſions are multiplied before thee, and our ſins teſtifie againſt us: for our tranſgreſſions are with us, and as for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, we know them,</hi> Iſa. 59. 10, 11, 12.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:123675:37"/>
               <p> Thirdly, the <hi>natural death,</hi> that is alſo the wages of ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And unto</hi> Adam <hi>God ſaid: Becauſe thou haſt hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and haſt eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, ſaying, thou ſhalt not eat of it: curſed is the ground for thy ſake, in ſorrow ſhalt thou eat of it all the dayes of thg life. Thorns and Thiſtles ſhall it bring forth to thee, and thou ſhalt eat the Herb of the field. In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread, untill thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn unto the ground: for out of it waſt thou taken; for duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return,</hi> Gen. 3. 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, <hi>eternal death</hi> is the puniſhment of ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it ſhall come to paſſe, that from one new Moon to another, and from one Sabbath to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſhall all fleſh come to worſhip before me, ſaith the Lord. And they ſhall go forth, and look upon the carcaſes of the men that have tranſgreſſed againſt me: for their worm ſhall not die, neither ſhall their fire be quenched, and they ſhall be an abhorring unto all fleſh,</hi> Iſa. 66. 23, 24.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee, that ſin hath laid us open to every degree of death and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>And verily the penalty annexed unto the breach of the Covenant of works (that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:123675:37"/> rebellion) importeth no otherwiſe: <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> Gen. 2. 17. <hi>Dying thou ſhalt die,</hi> ſaith the original. Thou ſhalt die every kinde of death.</p>
               <p>And now if it be demanded, how it may be ſaid that we are redeemed from theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, diſtreſſes, and calamities by this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace?</hi> I anſwer, that Almighty <hi>God</hi> hath redeemed us from them, by taking away the onely cauſe of them, which we find here to be ſin.</p>
               <p>And that for, and through the merits and mediation, the ſufferings and ſatisfaction of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, his onely begotten Son:</hi> whom he gave us, and for us in this <hi>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Provided alwayes that we receive him by faith, according to the condition of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
               <p>And here we may do well to take notice, That the evil of ſin is three-fold: That is to ſay:</p>
               <p>The guilt of ſin, The puniſhment of ſin, And the power of ſin. And it is neceſſary that all theſe be removed, before we can cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be ſaid to be redeemed. For where the guilt remaineth, the puniſhment is not to be avoided: and whileſt the power conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth, neither ſhall the guilt be forgotten,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:123675:38"/> nor the puniſhment forgiven. You know that whoſoever tranſgreſſeth the Law, and is found guilty thereof: he muſt ſuffer pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, according to the nature of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. And whoſoever committeth ſinne, tranſgreſſeth the Law. <hi>For ſin is the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law,</hi> 1 John 3. 4.</p>
               <p>Now where is that Soul that dares ſtand upon her own juſtification, and plead, Not guilty, to the whole Law of God?</p>
               <p>Or whether our own hearts condemne us, or not, <hi>God is greater then our hearts, and knoweth all things,</hi> 1 John 3. 20.</p>
               <p>It is in vain for us to diſſemble, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal our iniquities: <hi>For all things are naked, and opened unto the eyes of him, with whom we have to do,</hi> Heb. 4. 13.</p>
               <p>Verily the <hi>Lord</hi> ſees our ſins before we commit them. <hi>I knew that thou wouldeſt deal very treacher<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>uſly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and waſt called a tranſgreſſour from the womb,</hi> Iſa. 48. 8. And he that tranſgreſſeth the Law in the leaſt particular, he is curſed: For it is written:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things, that are written in the book of the Law, to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10.</p>
               <p>And being curſed, he can expect no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then to be condemned unto eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:123675:38"/>
               <p> For the Son of Man ſitting upon the throne of his glory, ſhall ſay unto them. <hi>Depart from me, ye curſed into everlaſting fire, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Devil and his Angels,</hi> Math. 25. 41.</p>
               <p>But being poſſeſſed of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t,</hi> by an effectual faith (according to the tenour of this <hi>Covenant of Grace)</hi> we are redeemed both from the Curſe. <hi>For Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3. 13.</p>
               <p>And from the penalty thereupon depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities: the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our peace was upon him: and with his ſtripes we are healed,</hi> Iſa. 53. 5.</p>
               <p>And moreover of guilty ſinners, we are become juſtified Saints.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For we have all ſinned, and come ſhort of the glory of God. Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt: whom God hath ſet forth to be a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, through faith in his bloud: to declare his righteouſneſſe for the remiſſion of ſins that are paſt, through the forbearance of God,</hi> Rom. 3. 23, 24, 25.</p>
               <p>In which words we finde the moving, or procuring cauſe of our juſtification to be the

               <p>
                  <hi>That he might be juſt, in being the juſtifier of him, which believeth in Jeſus,</hi> verſe 26.</p>
               <p>For as it is juſt with <hi>God</hi> to puniſh the ſins of a Reprobate, that dieth in his iniquity: So it is as juſt with him to pardon the ſins of a believer, for which <hi>Chriſt</hi> died.</p>
               <p>And as the true believer is delivered from the guilt and puniſhment of ſin by the merit of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> So is he alſo preſerved from the power of ſin by the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this he doth: <hi>By redeeming us from our vain converſation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By purging our conſciences from dead works to ſerve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By crucifying our old man, the body of ſin,</hi> Rom. 6. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By freeing us from the Law, the ſtrength of ſin,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 56, 57.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>By ſtrengthening us with might in the inner man,</hi> Eph. 3. 16. And <hi>by making us parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the Divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4.</p>

               <p>But foraſmuch as there muſt be a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life, before there can be an eternal life:</p>
               <p>Therefore, as I have formerly ſet forth unto you the ſeveral ſorts, or degrees of death: So I ſhall here endeavour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o ſhew you the ſeveral ſorts, or degrees of life: which I conceive to be likewiſe four: That is to ſay, The <hi>natural life; The ſpiritual life; The peacefull life,</hi> and the <hi>eternal,</hi> or <hi>everlaſting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſecondly, I ſhall apply my ſelf to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:123675:41"/> prove, that every one of them (as a Member, or paſſage of, or to this everlaſting life) is part, or parcel of that eternal inheritance, whereunto the <hi>Son of God</hi> hath intituled us by vertue of this <hi>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt, I ſay, is the <hi>natural life,</hi> or the life of Nature: That which we ſay, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from our Parents: And it conſiſteth in the union of the body and the Soul, or of the fleſh and ſpirit: according to the vulgar ſenſe. But in the Scripture ſenſe, that is properly called the natural life, wherein a man followeth Nature for his chief, or onely guide. And of ſuch a one St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes: <hi>That the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe unto him: neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14.</p>
               <p>Now, this natural life in either of theſe ſenſes may be ſaid to be the iſſue of the firſt birth, or of the fleſhly generation. <hi>For that which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh,</hi> ſaith our <hi>Lord,</hi> Joh. 3. 6.</p>
               <p>And <hi>they that are after the fleſh, do minde the things of the fleſh,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8. 5.</p>
               <p>Verily, whoſoever liveth meerly this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life, or this life of Nature onely it were better for him that he had never lived at all, that he had never been born. <hi>For we are all</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:123675:41"/> 
                  <hi>by nature the children of wrath.</hi> According to that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph. 2. 3.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, though accidentally by reaſon of the corruption of Nature, this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life tendeth towards eternal death: Yet originally, and as it affordeth a being to the Creature, without which he could not be capable of everlaſting life: So, it may properly be ſaid to be part of <hi>Chriſts</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, and included within the compaſſe of this <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next is the <hi>ſpiritual life. For that was not firſi, which is ſpiritual, but that which is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and afterward that which is ſpiritual,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 46.</p>
               <p>This ſpiritual life is the fruit of that rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or new birth, whereby we are ſaid to be <hi>born of God,</hi> John 1. 13.</p>
               <p>And this birth is perfected, when the ſeed of the word is quickned by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> in the womb of <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, the ſeed of this new birth muſt be the word of <hi>God. Being born again, not of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible: by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> this word muſt be quickned by the <hi>Spirit. It is the Spirit that quickneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing: the words, that I ſpake unto</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:123675:42"/> 
                  <hi>you they are ſpirit, and they are life,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Son of God,</hi> John 6. 63.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, this word muſt be quickned by the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the womb of <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>John,</hi> 1 John 5. 1.</p>
               <p>And this may really be called a life, for it ſhall never be overcome of death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die: but if ye through the ſpirit do mor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Live eternally, for none can live this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life: this life of grace, but he that is raiſed from the death of ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed and holy is he, that hath part in the firſt reſurrection: on ſuch the ſecond death hath no power, but they ſhall be Prieſts of God and Chriſt, and ſhall reigne with him a thouſand yeaos,</hi> Rev. 20. 6.</p>
               <p>A thouſand years: Not according to the <hi>Millenaries</hi> account, who dream of an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdom to continue for a thouſand years, contrary to that of <hi>Chriſt himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>John</hi> 18. 36. But whileſt they contend for this earthly Kingdom: doth it not appear, that, <hi>Their wiſdom is earthly, ſenſual,</hi> &amp;c. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of St. <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 3. 15.</p>
               <p>But a thouſand years: The thouſand years
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:123675:42"/> of the great Sabbath, that eternal Jubilee, that ſhall be celebrated by the Saints of <hi>God</hi> in that everlaſting Kingdom of our <hi>Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 11.</p>
               <p>Verily this ſpiritual life is the greateſt good, that we can injoy in this World. Whileſt we live a meer natural life, we live, at the beſt, but to our ſelves: and we ſhall finde our ſelves, but bad pay-maſters. <hi>He is an empty Vine, that bringeth forth fruit unto himſelf,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord</hi> by his Prophet, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 10. 1.</p>
               <p>But in ſerving our ſelves, we commonly ſerve worſe Maſters then our ſelves: For we ſerve ſin alſo. <hi>Whoſoever committeth ſin, is the ſervant of ſin,</hi> ſaith our <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 8. 34. <hi>And the wages of ſinne is death,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 6. 23. Yea, and in ſerving ſin and our ſelves, we ſerve the Devil too. <hi>In time paſt ye walked according to the courſe of this world, according to the prince of the power of the aire, the ſpirit that now worketh in the children of diſobedience,</hi> Eph. 2. 2.</p>
               <p>And from ſuch a curſed Maſter we can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect but a ſorry reward. The Devils wages is a <hi>Mark,</hi> Rev. 13. 16. But he that receiveth that Mark: <hi>The ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation, and he</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:123675:43"/> 
                  <hi>ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone in the preſence of the holy Angels, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 14. 10.</p>
               <p>But being by this new birth, or this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life delivered from theſe bad Maſters: we are ſure of a bleſſing. <hi>For being made free from ſin, and become ſervants to God: Ye have your fruit unto holineſſe, and the end, everlaſting life,</hi> Rom. 6. 22. And the end everlaſting life.</p>
               <p>You ſee here, that the end of this <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life,</hi> is <hi>everlaſting life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in regard that many do diſ-reliſh, and diſlike this ſpiritual life as diſquiet and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable, therefore I ſhall deſire you to take the peacefull life in your paſſage. St. <hi>Paul,</hi> exhorteth, <hi>That ſupplications, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks be made for all men: for Kings, and all that are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life in all godlineſſe and honeſty,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>I will not deny, but there are many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, both ſpiritual and temporal, that do continually endeavour to infeſt and moleſt this happy paſſage towards eternity.</p>
               <p>But what hurt, or hinderance can it be to a well reſolved ſpirit, though the Devil with all his ſmoaky legions do thunder forth their phantaſtick falſe alarums?</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:123675:43"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>The Lord will give ſtrength unto his people: the Lord will bleſſe his people with peace,</hi> ſaith that man of War, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you, not as the world giveth, give I unto you: let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 17. And he that ſaid it, is well able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it: <hi>For he is the prince of peace,</hi> Iſa. 9. 6.</p>
               <p>This is the peace of <hi>God,</hi> and it is more then an ordinary peace. It is a perfect, and a perpetual peace: an infinite, and an inward peace. Firſt, it is a perfect peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe minde is ſtayed on thee: becauſe he truſteth in thee,</hi> ſaith that Evangelical Prophet to his, and our <hi>God,</hi> Iſa. 26. 3.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is a perpetual peace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Mountains ſhall depart, and the Hills be removed, but my kindneſſe ſhall not depart from thee, neither ſhall the covenant of my peace be removed, ſaith the Lord that hath mercy on thee.</hi> According to that of the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 10.</p>
               <p>Not ſo perfect and perpetual, that it ſhall never be interrupted, but ſo perfect and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, that it ſhall never be utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is an infinite peace, it paſſeth all underſtanding.</p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:123675:44"/>
               <p> And fourthly, it is an inward peace: It keepeth your hearts and mindes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The peace of God, which paſſeth all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, ſhall keep your hearts and mindes,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
               <p>Yea, and it is an outward peace alſo, <hi>when a mans wayes pleaſe the Lord. he maketh even his enemies, to be at peace with him,</hi> ſaith that wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 7. Or if they will not, it ſhall be upon their own peril.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For his heart is eſtabliſhed, he ſhall not be afraid, untill he ſee his deſire upon his enemies,</hi> Pſal. 112. 8.</p>
               <p>This is the peacefull life, or the ſpiritual mans peacefull paſſage to eternal ſalvation, or <hi>everlaſting life:</hi> which is the fourth and laſt degree, and that which is expreſſed here in this <hi>Copy:</hi> as the onely intire happineſſe, and perfection of all the former.</p>
               <p>For the matter, what theſe Covenanters do injoy in this eternal life: we finde it ſhadowed out unto us under the notion of <hi>Abrahams boſome,</hi> Luke 16. 22. as being the ſecure, and ſafe receptacle for all the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the faith.</p>

               <p>For the manner how the faithfull are to enjoy this everlaſting life. St. <hi>John</hi> telleth us, that: <hi>They are before the Throne of God, and ſerve him day and night in his Temple: and he that ſitteth on the Throne ſhall dwell among them.</hi>

For the Lamb which is in the midſt of the Throne ſhall feed them, and ſhall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes,</hi> Rev. 7. 15. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>

               <p> And now I am to prove, that every one of theſe ſeveral ſorts, or degrees of life, is part of <hi>Chriſts</hi> purchaſe, conferred upon us, for, and through his merits and mediation, and that in, and by this <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>

               <p>And for the more clear manifeſtation hereof, I deſire you ſtill to conſider, that whatſoever <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath done, or ſuffered for, and on the behalf of mankinde, the ſame he did and ſuffered before the world began: not onely intentionally according to our underſtanding, but effectually and actually according to the tenor of <hi>Gods</hi> will, and the ſatisfaction of his juſtice. <hi>He was the Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world,</hi> Rev. 13. 8.</p>

               <p>You know, though a man hath a bad, or a bankrupt debitour, yet if he hath a good ſufficient ſurety, he will not be haſty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the penalty upon the poor principal: in regard that he is well aſſured of full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction from the ſurety: and haply upon that ſecurity he keeps the bond unſued for divers years after the forfeiture, even till his own occaſions call upon him.</p>

               <p>And next I deſire you to call to minde what <hi>Moſes,</hi> that man of <hi>God,</hi> hath delivered concerning the Creation. How <hi>God</hi> in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the light, the firmament, the waters, the earth, and thoſe other Creatures neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and convenient for mans uſe, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation: He onely ſaid, <hi>let it be ſo, and it was ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But coming in concluſion to make man: he calls his privy Councel <hi>Son and Spirit,</hi> and ſayes, <hi>Let us make man in our own image, after our likeneſſe; and let him have domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over the fiſh of the Sea, and over the fowle of the aire, and over the Cattel, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth,</hi> Gen. 1. 26.</p>
               <p>As if he had ſaid, this is our great vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent, this is he, for whoſe ſake, and for whoſe poſterity we have created this great univerſe: And on whoſe behalf we did conclude that <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> to take effect at the inſtant of his fall: That ſo both
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:123675:46"/> he, and all his ſeed may know, it is not of themſelves whereby they ſtand, but meerly of our goodneſſe and our grace: which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by a lively faith, their faith will work obedience by love.</p>
               <p>Therefore let us make man in our own image, &amp;c. In the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> verſe 27. Man is created, in the 28. verſe he is bleſſed, in the 29. verſe he receives his Commiſſion: In the ſecond Chapter at the 16. and 17. verſes he receives his charge: The <hi>Covenant of works:</hi> In the third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at the ſixth verſe he forfeits his recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance: In the ninth verſe <hi>God</hi> gives him ſummons: And in the fifteenth verſe he ſhews him his <hi>Saviour: The ſeed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, leaſt man ſhould grow too idle, too inſolent, or too old in his iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: In the 19th. verſe of the ſame third Chapter: God ſhews him his <hi>Task:</hi> his <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal,</hi> and his <hi>End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the ſweat of thy face thou ſhalt eat bread, till thou return unto the ground:</hi> there is his task. <hi>For out of it waſt thou taken:</hi> there is his original. <hi>For duſt thou art, and unto duſt ſhalt thou return:</hi> there is his end.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay: If there were ſuch a precontract, ſuch a <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:123675:46"/> provided, as you ſpeak of, why did not <hi>Chriſt</hi> thereby deliver <hi>Adam,</hi> and his poſterity from this tedious task, this ſenſe of their baſe extraction, and this ſubjection to a ſad return? I anſwer, that in the firſt place (we may conceive) that our <hi>Creatour</hi> thought it neceſſary to leave us in perpetual imployment, thereby to keep us ſtill in action, we have a proverb, that idleneſſe is the mother of all evil.</p>
               <p>But, without doubt, idleneſſe is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils beſt opportunity. It is like that the Serpent found <hi>Eve</hi> gazing: as <hi>Shechem</hi> found <hi>Dina</hi> gadding: otherwiſe the one had not been ſo ſoon deceived; nor the other ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily defiled.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he was pleaſed to continue us under the ſenſe of our contemptible origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, to keep us from preſumption &amp; pride. Had <hi>Adam</hi> formerly conſidered the ſimple ſtuffe whereof he was created: haply the haughty deſire of being like his <hi>Maſter</hi> had not made him <hi>Gods</hi> enemy. <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaith <hi>Abraham) I have taken upon me to ſpeak unto the Lord, which am but duſt and aſhes,</hi> Gen. 18. 27.</p>
               <p>There is his humility. <hi>And he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the friend of God,</hi> James 2. 23.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, he left us ſubject unto death,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:123675:47"/> even by that means to better our condition. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead, which die in the Lord,</hi> (ſaith <hi>the Spirit) that they may reſt from their labours,</hi> Rev. 14. 13.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe that in the interim, in the time of this natural life, he might keep our Souls in action as well as our bodies: whileſt <hi>we walk by faith, and not by ſight.</hi> According to that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
               <p>But where is then the benefit (you will ſay) of this eternal <hi>Covenant of Grace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer, that (as our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did therein, and thereby redeem us from all manner of death, as it is a curſe, or a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment for ſin, as I have already proved) ſo I ſhall now endeavour to prove that he hath therein, and thereby purchaſed and procured for us every ſort, or degree of life, as it is a part of, or a paſſage to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſalvation.</p>
               <p>And firſt, concerning the firſt kinde, being the <hi>natural life.</hi> This <hi>Adam</hi> injoyed but conditionally.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the day that thou eateſt of the Tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou ſhalt ſurely die</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Covenant of works.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>Adam</hi> eateth, and muſt die there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: his preſent farewell to this natural life muſt be his welcome to eternal death.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:123675:47"/> When in that very inſtant <hi>Chriſt</hi> our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our</hi> appears for <hi>Man:</hi> And by virtue of that precontract he ſtayes <hi>Gods</hi> juſtice, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves mans life. And by this means we all injoy our lives. For had <hi>Adam</hi> then died, according to his deſert, we had all died in him as the fruit dieth in the root.</p>
               <p>It were little wiſdom to expect a poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from him that never did beget a Child: And it appeareth that he had not begotten any before that great rebellion of his, which called for preſent death.</p>
               <p>But afterward in the time of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive, <hi>Adam knew Eve his wife, and ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and bare Cain,</hi> Gen. 4. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſhe again bare his brother Abel,</hi> Gen. 4. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Adam knew his wife again, and ſhe bare a ſon, and called his name Seth,</hi> Geneſ. 4. 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the dayes of Adam after he had begotten Seth, were eight hundred years, and he begat ſons and daughters,</hi> Gen. 5. 4.</p>
               <p>And whoſoever hath lived heretofore, do now live, or ſhall live hereafter: They did, do, and ſhall receive their natural life ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from that old feeble ſtock. And therefore his life being preſerved to a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity by <hi>Chriſt</hi> in this <hi>Covenant of Grace:</hi> It follows neceſſarily that we do all receive our natural lives meerly by virtue of that <hi>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:123675:48"/>
               <p> The ſecond ſort, or degree is the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life: This (as I ſaid) is the fruit of regeneration, or of the new birth. In our firſt birth we are born men. In our ſecond birth we are born Chriſtians, good men, bleſſed men.</p>
               <p>The firſt benefit that we received by this Covenant of Grace is our Election in <hi>Chriſt</hi> before the foundation of the world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 4. The ſecond benefit is our natural life; which we received in <hi>Adams</hi> reprive by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the ſaid <hi>Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I dare not call this a benefit abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, or otherwiſe then as it putteth us into a poſſibility of attaining unto this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life.</p>
               <p>And therefore the firſt Leſſon that our <hi>Saviour</hi> taught unto <hi>Nichodemus</hi> was the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Regeneration, ſaying, <hi>verily, veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſay unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God,</hi> John 3. 3.</p>
               <p>The next abſolute, and undeniable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit proceeding from this <hi>Covenant,</hi> is the ſpiritual life: whereby we become the ſons of <hi>God:</hi> not according to any carnal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but according to the <hi>Spirit of adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Rom. 8. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>By this ſpiritual life we likewiſe become ſenſible of the firſt benefit conveyed unto
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:123675:48"/> us in this <hi>Covenant:</hi> being our <hi>Election?</hi> which cannot be perceived, either in us, or by us in the ſtate of nature, before we begin to live this life of grace. And for this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual life alſo, if we deſire to know it, either in our ſelves, or others, we ſhall finde that it conſiſteth in the putting off the old man, and putting on the new. <hi>Ye ought ſo to learn Chriſt: that ye put off, concerning the former converſation, the old man, which is corrupt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the deceitfull luſts: And be renewed in the ſpirit of y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In this ſpiritual life it pleaſed the <hi>Father of our L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And by this means it cometh to paſſe that they, which live this ſpiritual life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their eyes are opened, they are turned from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan unto God: that, they may receive forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſins, an inheritance with them, which</hi>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:123675:49"/> 
                  <hi>are ſanctified by faith, which is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Acts 26. 18.</p>
               <p>And all this we injoy in, and through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If Chriſt be in you the body is dead, becauſe of ſin: but the Spirit is life, becauſe of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 10.</p>
               <p>I have not read of any, whom I conceive to have lived this life of grace more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully then St. <hi>Paul</hi> did: Neither was he aſhamed to confeſſe how, and from whom he received it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Likewiſe reckon ye alſo your ſelves to be dead indeed unto ſin: but alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 11.</p>
               <p>Verily our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is not onely the procurer, and purchaſer of this ſpiritual life: but alſo the Authour, and the eſſence thereof. <hi>The dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live: for as the Father hath life in himſelf, ſo hath he given to the Son to have life in himſelf,</hi> Joh. 5. 25. 26.</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:123675:49"/>
               <p> And again, <hi>I am the Reſurrection, and the life</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chriſt) he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live,</hi> John 11. 25.</p>
               <p>Though he were dead in ſin, yet ſhall he live by grace: <hi>And you being dead in your ſins, and the uncircumciſion of your fleſh, hath he quickned together with Chriſt, having forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you all your treſpaſſes,</hi> ſaith St. Paul, Col. 2. 13.</p>
               <p>And as this great benefit is conferred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, in, and by the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> ſo is it likewiſe confirmed unto us, in, and by this <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As for thy Nativity in the day thou waſt born, thy Navel was not cut, neither waſt thou waſhed in water, to ſupple thee: thou waſt not ſalted at all, nor ſwadled at all. None eye pitied thee, to do any of theſe things unto thee, to have compaſſion upon thee: but thou waſt caſt out in the open field, to the loathing of thy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in the day that thou waſt born,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord</hi> by his Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Here is the wretched eſtate of every Soul by nature, in regard of ſin: delivered ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly concerning <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but is to be applied to <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his poſterity. <hi>But when I paſſed by thee, ſaith the Lord, and ſaw thee polluted in thine own bloud, I ſaid unto</hi>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I have cauſed thee to multiply, as the bud of the field, and thou haſt increaſed, and waxen great, and thou art come to excellent orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: thy breaſts are faſhioned, and thine haire is grown, whereas thou waſt naked and bare,</hi> Ezek. 16. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>See here the wonderfull incomprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble goodneſſe of our <hi>God,</hi> not onely in pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying, and reviving the poor Soul miſerably polluted, and even dead in the gore, and filth of her natural ſins and corruptions: But alſo in ſupplying, and inriching her with moſt beautifull Ornaments, Allegorically re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the graces, and indowments belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a ſpiritual life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now when I paſſed by thee, and looked upon thee, behold thy time was the time of love: and I ſpread my skirt over thee, and covered thy nakedneſſe: yea, I ſware unto thee: and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a Covenant with thee,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord,</hi> verſe 8.</p>
               <p>And what Covenant can any man ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine this to be, but an expreſſe, or a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of that eternal <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, who can expect theſe undeſerved fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, but by, and through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our</hi>

                  <hi>Lord,</hi> the onely <hi>Mediatour</hi> of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant? And being ſuch bleſſings as no man can receive from <hi>God,</hi> but by the hand of a lively faith: according to the condition of that Covenant.</p>
               <p>We come now to prove that the peacefull life, or the ſpiritual mans peacefull paſſage to eternity, is vouchſafed unto us, in, and through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> by virtue of this <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherein I deſire you to underſtand, that it is not an outward, or a worldly peace, that I intend in this place. For albeit the <hi>Lord</hi> promiſeth his people upon their reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and return.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in that day he will make a Covenant for them with the beaſts of the field, and with the fowles of Heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground, and that he will break the bow, and the ſword, and the battle out of the earth, and make them to lie down ſafely, as</hi> Hoſ. 2. 18.</p>
               <p>Yet without doubt, this promiſe was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generally, nor abſolutely intended: but conditionally, even as he in his wiſdome ſhould ſee it to be good and nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that in me ye might have peace: in the world ye ſhall have tribulation,</hi> John 16. 33.</p>
               <p>A Child of <hi>God</hi> ſhall never want adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſo long as the Devil hath any agents, or inſtruments abroad: yet he is not without his ſeveral comforts, and preventions. For when he firſt diſcovers them, he conſiders them to be <hi>Gods</hi> enemies alſo: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he leaves them wholy unto <hi>Gods</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when they begin to rouze themſelves: he looks the more narrowly to his own wayes, leaſt his indiſcretion ſhould give them the greater advantage.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, when they purſue him with violence, he maketh merily towards his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, his ſtrong hold.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He truſteth in the Lord for ever: for in the the Lord</hi> Jehovah <hi>is everlaſting ſtrength,</hi> Iſa. 26. 4. The peace of a true believer may be ſhaken, but not utterly overthrown; All the world cannot beat him from his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God: for albeit he is very ſenſible of his own weakneſſe: yet he is ſure of a powerfull Peace-maker.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 5. 1.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:123675:51"/>
               <p> Yea, <hi>The peace of God, which paſſeth all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſhall keep your hearts and mindes through Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 7.</p>
               <p>You will ſay, This is by <hi>Chriſt:</hi> but how is it by Covenant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will make a Covenant of peace with them, it ſhall be an everlaſting Covenant with them,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord,</hi> concerning his Church, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 26. This indeed is a Covenant of peace (you will ſay) and an everlaſting Covenant. But what is this to that eternal <hi>Covenant of Grace?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer firſt, had it not been for that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Covenant: No Creature, after <hi>Adams</hi> rebellion had ever been capable of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Covenant for good.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we may be confident, that <hi>God</hi> did never make any Covenant whatſoever, to, or with mankinde ſince the Creation, but it hath its relation to that Original Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace. The very Covenant of works made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and exemplified to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> as a rule of life in the Moral Law, or the Law of the ten Commandments, diſcovereth unto us that enmity between <hi>God</hi> and us, together with our own infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and inabilities: and ſendeth us to ſeek for reconciliation by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt: By whom</hi>

               <p>And in order unto this diſcovery: It will be very convenient that we do firſt lay down this firm foundation.</p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:123675:53"/>
               <p> That <hi>Faith</hi> is the onely <hi>evidence,</hi> which either doth, or can make good our Title to eternal ſalvation: That more then moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent inheritance, which the Saints of <hi>God,</hi> do, and ſhall injoy in the Kingdom of glorie.</p>

                  <hi>Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 1.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Hath not God choſen the poor of this world, rich in Faith, and Heirs to the Kingdom,</hi>

                  <hi>which God hath promiſed to them that love him,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle James, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 5.</p>

               <p>And to confirm us yet more perfectly in this general truth, we finde <hi>Faith</hi> to be the onely <hi>condition</hi> exemplified in this <hi>Copy</hi> of that <hi>Covenant;</hi> whereby we ſtand intituled to everlaſting life, even from all eternity.</p>
               <p>

                     <hi>The obſtinate Offender,</hi>

                     <hi>The ignorant Infidel,</hi>

               </list>
               <p>And in them I ſhall briefly conſider their <hi>Actions:</hi> their <hi>Allegations,</hi> and their <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt in this Catalogue is the <hi>obſtinate Offender.</hi> And by him I intend ſuch a one as runneth on in his ſins, according to a Reprobate ſenſe, without contradiction, or remorſe of conſcience. I ſhall give you no other account of his actions, then what I finde recorded by the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Leaſt, by lighting accidentally upon the corruptions of ſome particular perſons, I be looked upon, either as envious, or injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In the tenth <hi>Pſalm</hi> beginning at the fourth verſe: the Prophet <hi>David</hi> deſcribeth him thus. Firſt, by his Pride.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The wicked through the pride of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance will not ſeek after God: God is not in all his thoughts,</hi> verſe 4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, by his Behaviour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His wayes are alwayes grievous: thy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are far above out of his ſight: as for all his enemies he puffeth at them,</hi> verſe 5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, by his Security.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He hath ſaid in his heart, I ſhall not be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: for I ſhall never be in adverſity,</hi> ver. 6.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:123675:54"/>
               <p> Fourthly, by his Subtilty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His mouth is full of curſing and deceit: under his tongue is miſchief, and vanity,</hi> ver. 7.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, by his Treachery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He ſitteth in the lurking places of the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, in the ſecret places doth he murder the innocent, his eyes are privily ſet againſt the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>or. He lyeth in wait ſecretly, as a Lion in his Den, he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his Net: he crouhceth, and humbleth himſelf, that the poor may fall by his ſtrong ones,</hi> verſes 8, 9, and 10.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, and laſtly, by his Blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He hath ſaid in his heart God hath forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: he hideth his face, he will never ſee it, verſe</hi> 11. Theſe are his <hi>Actions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither are his <hi>Allegations</hi> any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuteable. For let either Magiſtrate, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, or any private friend reprove, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh him concerning the evil of his ways, or the ſad condition of his poor Soul: And they ſhall ſoon finde that he will return re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches for reproofs, and bad language for good counſel. What do you think he knows not what he hath to do, as wel; as any fooliſh Hypocrite of them all?</p>
               <p>Is there any man that doth not ſin? He that ſaith to the contrary is a lyar.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:123675:55"/>
               <p> What are his offences, but infirmities, or humane frailties: And he can ſay as much, or more by other men, then they can ſay by him.</p>
               <p>Theſe are his beſt thanks: But commonly he is ſo throughly inſtructed by the Devil his Maſter: that with lying accuſations, and ſcornfull Allegations, he is able to ſilence the moſt confident Chriſtian living.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay: dares any wicked wretch, ſo odious in the ſight of <hi>God</hi> and man, lay claim unto this heavenly inheritance? Yea, verily dares he: For if pride and contempt will afford him ſo much patience, as to hear, or diſcourſe concerning the ſame: he is ready preſently to produce his <hi>evidence:</hi> And commonly part of it will be this.</p>
               <p>He believes that <hi>God</hi> is mercifull, for did he not proclaim himſelf after this manner?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Lord: The Lord God, mercifull and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and truth: keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving iniquity, tranſgreſſion, and ſin,</hi> Exod. 34. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>And what can any man deſire more? Why I deſire that he would proceed a little further in that ſeventh verſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And that will by no means clear the guilty.</hi> But this is paſt his learning, and contrary to his liking.</p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:123675:55"/>
               <p> For by this it appears that this <hi>evidence</hi> of his is nothing worth.</p>
               <p>For <hi>God</hi> is not ſo mercifull as to deſtroy his Juſtice: Neither can he in Juſtice pardon ſin without ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>But yet he is nevertheleſſe confident in his Title: For this is but one clauſe of his <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> he proceedeth yet further, and ſaith, he groundeth his aſſurance upon that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Paul;</hi> where he telleth <hi>Timothy: That Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of whom he is chief,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15.</p>
               <p>Who doubts of that? But he muſt know that the true ſaving Faith conſiſteth not in believing, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> came into the World to ſave ſinners: But in receiving <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and applying the promiſe to our own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, whereby we get aſſurance, that he is ours, and we are his.</p>
               <p>According to that of the faithful ſpouſe: <hi>My beloved is mine</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>&amp; I am his,</hi> Can. 2. 16</p>
               <p>And thefore the foreſaid Apoſtle <hi>Paul: Know ye not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be Reprobates,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 5.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall a man know whether <hi>Chriſt</hi> be in him, or not?</p>
               <p>Why, <hi>If Chriſt be in you, the body is dead, becauſe of ſin: but the ſpirit is life, becauſe of righteouſneſſe,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, Rom. 8. 10.</p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:123675:56"/>
               <p> See how this miſerable wicked wretch deceives himſelf to the diſhonour of God, and the deſtruction of his own Soul.</p>
               <p>Not like a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> but a <hi>Cretian:</hi> Whileſt he profeſſeth that he knoweth God, but in works he denieth him, being abominable, diſobedient, and to every good work reprobate: As <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
               <p>And it is impoſſible, that any Reprobate ſhould inherit the Kingdom of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fleſh and bloud cannot do it,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 50.</p>
               <p>Much leſſe ſhall any thing enter therein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>That defileth, or worketh abomination, or maketh a lye,</hi> Rev. 21. 27.</p>
               <p>And therefore this firſt <hi>Pretender,</hi> this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate <hi>Offender</hi> hath no intereſt at all in this glorious inheritance.</p>
               <p>The ſecond <hi>Pretender</hi> thereunto, is the <hi>Ignorant Infidel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fool that ſaith in his heart, there is no God,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 1.</p>
               <p>Haply with his mouth he may acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a kinde of an unknown <hi>God:</hi> Yet in his heart he conceiveth no otherwiſe of him, then a meer fancy.</p>
               <p>But if you come to ſhew him: how that <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father, God the Son,</hi> and <hi>God</hi> the holy <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> are but one <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet nevertheleſſe, that <hi>God the Father</hi> did
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:123675:56"/> make a Covenant with <hi>God the Son,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Teſtimony of <hi>God</hi> the Holy <hi>Ghoſt.</hi> That this covenant was concluded purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to redeem the world, before the world was created: and that by virtue of the ſame cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant it is as agreeable with Gods Juſtice to pardon ſin, as to puniſh it: With the like ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary principles: Why, you tell him won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſo far above his capacity, that he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to trouble his brains about them. Truely, all his actions do too much expreſſe his ignorance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whileſt he walketh in the vanity of his minde: having the underſtanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in him: becauſe of the blindneſſe of his heart; who being paſt feeling, hath given himſelf over unto laſciviouſneſſe, to work all uncleanneſſe with greedineſſe:</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 17. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>But he will alledge, that if ignorance be an offence, yet <hi>God</hi> will eaſily forgive it: in regard it is a thing ſo general among ſimple people, that were never brought up to much learning.</p>
               <p>I anſwer: Firſt, he muſt know, that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is an offence, and a great one too. For we finde that the <hi>Lord</hi> proteſted againſt it in his own Children.</p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:123675:57"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Hear, O Heavens</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and give eare O earth, for the Lord hath ſpoken: I have nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and brought up Children, and they have rebelled againſt me. The Oxe knoweth his owner, and the Aſſe his maſters Crib: but</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>doth not know, my people doth not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Ah! ſinfull Nation: a people laden with iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 2. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it ſhall not be forgiven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels, In flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Theſ. 1. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, the generality thereof ſhall rather haſten, then hinder the Juſtice of <hi>God</hi> to puniſh it. We ſhall not need to runne over the whole word of <hi>God,</hi> for the many examples of whole Cities and Kingdoms, to prove the truth of this particular: If we ſhall conſider how, and wherefore <hi>God</hi> deſtroyed the whole world, <hi>except</hi> 8. <hi>perſons,</hi> as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 20.</p>
               <p>If he alledgeth that it was for all ſorts of ſins, and not for ignorance that <hi>God</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict thoſe general, and univerſal judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I anſwer, that it is not ignorance ſimply conſidered, which I do principally point at: but ignorance circumſtantiated; ignorance with its effects, and acceſſaries.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:123675:57"/> Not ſuch a kind of ignorance as is in thoſe, whom we call <hi>Ideots:</hi> who have no compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent underſtanding, either in things ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, or natural. Nor ſuch an ignorance, in things ſpiritual, as is in thoſe, that never heard of the true <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both which I conceive to be the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the firſt original ſin, rather then ſin it ſelf: Neither are theſe excuſable in the day of Judgement, without <hi>Gods</hi> incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible mercy and goodneſſe, which I dare neither queſtion, nor confine.</p>
               <p>For the Apoſtle ſpeaketh generally, when he ſaith: <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 3.</p>

               <p>But I intend ſuch an ignorance in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual things, as is in them that have the word of <hi>God</hi> amongſt them, or not far from them: And yet, either through contempt, or wilfull neglect of the true light, they will rather chooſe to walk in darkneſſe, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſeek after, or to receive inſtruction. And this kinde of <hi>ignorance</hi> is not onely ſuch a great ſin, as ſhall be grievouſly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. But it is likewiſe the cauſe of all manner of ſin whatſoever.</p>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:123675:58"/>
               <p> Firſt, it is ſuch a great ſin, as ſhall be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly puniſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed</hi> (ſaith the <hi>wiſdom of God) I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded: but ye have ſet at nought all my counſel, and would none of my reproof: I alſo will laugh at your calamity. I will mock when your fear cometh: when your fear cometh as deſolation, and your deſtruction cometh as a whirlewinde: when diſtreſſe and anguiſh cometh upon you: then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer, they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not finde me: for that they hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the fear of the Lord,</hi> Prov. 1. 24. to 30.</p>
               <p>And thus the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe they have caſt away the law of the Lord of Hoſts, and deſpiſed the word of the holy one of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>therefore is the anger of the Lord kindled againſt his people, and he hath ſtretched forth his hand againſt them, and hath ſmitten them: and the Hills did tremble, and their Carcaſes were torn in the midſt of the ſtreets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 5. 24, 25.</p>
               <p>But he will alledge, that it is no abſolute ſigne of ignorance to reject the word of <hi>God,</hi> he may be a wiſe man for all that.</p>
               <p>I pray obſerve how the <hi>Lord</hi> anſwers him by his Prophet <hi>Jeremy.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The wiſe men are aſhamed: they are diſmayed and taken: Lo, they have rejected the word of Lord, and what wiſdom is in them,</hi> Jer. 8. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>A man may ſeem to be a wiſe man in his own opinion, and in the opinion of other men too. But <hi>the wiſdom of this world is fooliſhneſſe with God,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 19.</p>
               <p>And oftentimes it proveth deſtructive to the owner thereof. And therefore the <hi>Lord</hi> by his Prophet telleth the daughter of the <hi>Chaldeans: That her wiſdom and her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hath perverted her,</hi> Iſa. 47. 10.</p>
               <p>Verily to be carnally wiſe, is to be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually fooliſh. And as a wilfull, or a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ignorance is a great ſinne, and ſhall be grievouſly puniſhed: So in the next place <hi>ignorance</hi> in general is the cauſe of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſin.</p>
               <p>What ſhould cauſe the covetous wretch to rake, and ſcrape, and heap up money up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on money, and land upon land, by right, or by wrong: But becauſe he knoweth not, that, <hi>It is God onely that maketh poor, and maketh rich: that bringeth low, and lifteth up,</hi> as in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 7.</p>

               <p>Becauſe he knoweth not, that, <hi>They that will be rich, fall into temptation, and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh, and hurtfull luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition,</hi> as in the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That he that getteth riches, and not by right, ſhall leave them in the midſt of his dayes: and at his end ſhall be a fool,</hi> as <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 11.</p>
               <p>Peradventure he knows that theſe things are ſo written: but he is not ſo wiſe as to conſider, or perſwade himſelf of the truth thereof.</p>
               <p>Would the temporizing fool depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the arm of fleſh, and wave ſtill as the blaſt bloweth, like a Reed ſhaken with every winde? If he did know? <hi>That the Lord changeth not,</hi> as <hi>Mal.</hi> 3, 6.</p>
               <p>Would any prophane perſon blaſpheme the name of God: contemne his Ordinances: corrupt his truth, or pollute his ſabbaths? If he did know, that, <hi>He is an holy God, and a jealous God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 24. 19.</p>
               <p>Durſt the private Thief, the ſecret Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:123675:59"/> or the ſwinelike drunkard, looſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their baſe abominations: their fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy deeds of darkneſſe? If they knew, that <hi>Darkneſſe hideth not from God: and that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and light are both alike to him, as</hi> Pſalm 139. 12. <hi>Or that nothing is ſecret that ſhall not be manifeſt: neither any thing hid, that ſhall not be known, &amp; come abroad,</hi> according to that of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Luke 8. 17. Or in a word, durſt any wicked Reprobate whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, delight, and live in, or by his odious, and Soul-damning ſins?

               <p>But this <hi>ignorant Infidel</hi> will again alledge: That there are many men, that know as much of theſe things, as any man can tell them: and yet they continue in their ſinnes nevertheleſſe.</p>
               <p>Truely, of all fools they are the greateſt, and moſt ridiculous, that will make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves enemies to <hi>God,</hi> and ſlaves to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil: and that knowingly, and willingly. Yet this proveth nothing to the contrary, but that ignorance is the cauſe of ſinne. I conceive it will not be denied, but that the <hi>Jews,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were knowing men, both in the Law, &amp; the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:123675:60"/> Prophets, inſomuch that they could not be ignorant, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> ſhould come into the world: Nevertheleſſe, when he was come, they cried out inceſſantly to have him Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified.</p>
               <p>Now, albeit the death of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was the greateſt mercie that ever the <hi>Lord</hi> vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to the ſons of men: yet it was a moſt abominable ſin in thoſe that practiſed and procured it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou couldeſt have no power at all againſt me (ſaith our Saviour unto</hi> Pilate) <hi>except it were given thee from above: Therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater ſinne,</hi> John 19. 11.</p>
               <p>And thoſe great ſins, which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in order to his death, were carried on by ignorance, as St. <hi>Peter</hi> affirmeth to the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſaying,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye denied the holy one, and the juſt: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a murderer to be granted unto you: and killed the Prince of life, whom God hath raiſed from the dead, whereof we are witneſſes,</hi> Acts 3. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And now brethren, I wote that through ignorance ye did it: as did alſo your Rulers,</hi> verſe 17.</p>
               <p>And to this very purpoſe is that of Saint Paul, <hi>we ſpeak the wiſdom of God in a myſtery</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:123675:60"/> (ſaith he) <hi>even the hidden wiſdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory, which none of the Princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have Crucified the Lord of glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>And can any man imagine, that if <hi>Judas</hi> the Traitour had not been ignorant of the true value of his <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter:</hi> that ever he would have ſold him for thirty pieces of ſilver, and afterward have hanged himſelf upon the conſideration of his bad bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain?</p>
               <p>But this ignorant wretch will alledge yet further: That he can ſay the <hi>Lords prayer,</hi> the <hi>Creed,</hi> &amp; the ten <hi>Commandments;</hi> and he hopeth that this will be ſufficient to ſave the Soul of a man, that is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned.</p>
               <p>Truely, I cannot deny the ſanctified uſe of the <hi>Lords prayer</hi> (as ſome do in theſe dayes) for it is a very compleat and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious form, or pattern of prayer: preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and therefore not to be rejected by the pride of man. Yet many there are that do but onely ſay it, and that without either benefit, or comfort: for there are many thouſands that do not rightly underſtand ſo much as why they call <hi>God</hi> their <hi>Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:123675:61"/>
               <p> That which we call the Apoſtles <hi>Creed</hi> containeth the ſubſtance, or Hiſtory of the Goſpel: But being barely, or ſimply conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, without particular application, it will furniſh us, but with a bare Hiſtorical faith. The Devils believe it, and tremble nevertheleſſe.</p>
               <p>And as for the ten <hi>Commandments,</hi> they may ſhew him his tranſgreſſion, and ſo aſſure him of his damnation: But they can never bring him to Heaven, or ſo much as one ſtep towards it: unleſſe they lead him to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and there leave him. <hi>For there is none other name under Heaven given among men, whereby we muſt be ſaved,</hi> Acts 4. 12.</p>
               <p>But his concluding, and conquering <hi>Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> (as he conceiveth) will be this.</p>
               <p>He is confident that he ſhall do well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough yet: For did not <hi>Paul</hi> tell <hi>Timothy: That he was before a blaſphemer, and a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter, and injurious: but he obtained mercy, becauſe he did it ignorantly in unbelief,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 13.</p>
               <p>Now the ſins that he committeth are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ignorantly in unbelief: And why ſhould not he finde mercie as well as <hi>Paul?</hi> Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe he ſhall, if he ceaſeth not to follow <hi>Paul's</hi> example. But <hi>Paul</hi> obeyed <hi>Gods</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and converſion, and <hi>was not diſobedient</hi>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:123675:61"/> 
                  <hi>unto the heavenly viſion,</hi> Acts 26. 19. And in reference thereunto, inſtead of perſecuting as in time paſt, <hi>he preached the G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Whereas this wilfull wretch is ſtill as ignorant in the truth, as ever he was, and ſo he is like to continue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For though thou ſhouldeſt bray a fool in a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter among Wheat with a Peſtel: yet will not his fooliſhneſſe depart from him,</hi> ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 22.</p>
               <p>Theſe with many other blinde allegations he hath (for ignorance will ſeldom, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be put to ſilence.) Neither is he without his <hi>evidence.</hi> And it is this.</p>
               <p>He believeth that he ſhall eaſily ſay, <hi>Lord</hi> have mercie upon me, at the laſt hour. And then he doubteth not, but all will he well enough.</p>
               <p>For doth not the Prophet ſay, <hi>That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall call upon the name of the Lond, ſhall be ſaved?</hi> Joel. 2. 32.</p>
               <p>Yes, and ſo doth the Apoſtle too, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 13. But he proceedeth in the very next verſe. <hi>How ſhall they call on him, in whom they have not believed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he calleth, he muſt be ſure to be furniſhed with faith, or otherwiſe he muſt expect the like entertainment with his
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:123675:62"/> ſiſters, the five fooliſh Virgins: who, whileſt they went to provide Oyl for their Lamps, were ſhut out by the <hi>Bridegroom.</hi> And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that they came afterwards, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Lord, Lord, open unto us.</hi> Yet he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and ſaid: <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, I know you not,</hi> Mat. 25. 12.</p>
               <p>And would it not be the greateſt of all his follies, if he ſhould imagine, that <hi>God</hi> onely wiſe, will beſtow this glorious inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance upon them, whom he knoweth not? Whom he approveth not of?</p>
               <p>Without doubt, there will be no King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom prepared for ſuch, as are found unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive it. And therefore let this <hi>ignorant infidel</hi> learn to know, <hi>The onely true God,</hi> eſſentially, <hi>and Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath ſent,</hi> perſonally. <hi>For this is eternal life,</hi> John 17. 3. Or, otherwiſe it may be ſaid unto him, as ſometime Simon <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Simon</hi> the Sorcerer, upon an other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. <hi>Thou haſt neither part, nor lot in this matter. For thy heart is not right in the ſight of God,</hi> Acts 8. 21.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Pretender</hi> to this inheritance, is the <hi>good honeſt man:</hi> Or the man vulgarly ſo called, or reputed. Such a one as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth himſelf fairly and pleaſingly towards all men, endeavouring to get every mans
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:123675:62"/> good will, &amp; his good word, or if he cannot pleaſe all: yet he will be alwayes ſure to pleaſe the greateſt and the ſtrongeſt party. This <hi>good honeſt man</hi> runs through all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and imployments with as little offence, or annoyance to any of his Neighbours as may be. And therefore he doubteth not, but he hath a very good Title to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven: for is it not written?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let every one of us pleaſe his Neighbour, Rom.</hi> 15. 2. True: But the Apoſtle proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the ſame ſentence: <hi>For his good to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> Firſt, it muſt be for his good (not for his goods.) And ſecondly, it muſt be to edification: to build him up in piety, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and godlineſſe. For otherwiſe: <hi>To pleaſe men, is not to be the ſervant of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 1. 10.</p>
               <p>But he is confident in his <hi>evidence:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he ſetteth forth. That he doth, as he would be done by. And that is both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the intention of the Law, and the Prophets: and likewiſe, according to the command of our <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 12. And he believes, that this is very fair.</p>
               <p>It is indeed outwardly fair. But it hath a very foul inſide. Truely, this <hi>good honeſt man;</hi> notwithſtanding, this his uſurped Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, is a very counterfeit, a ſelf-ended Syco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant:

               <p>Yet I cannot, but ſubſcribe to part of his partial <hi>evidence. For he ſees a Thief, and conſenteth with him, and is partaker with the Adulterers, as</hi> Pſalm 50. 18.</p>
               <p>He endeavoureth to cover, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or excuſe all mens infirmities (as he calls them,) and to prevent every mans miſery: though it be a puniſhment infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted moſt juſtly upon a perſon moſt crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and culpable, even the moſt wicked offender that may be: And this (he ſaith) is his love: whereas, in truth it is his fear, leſt his own miſdeeds ſhould meet the like mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.

               <p>Yet it appeareth that it proceeded out of a zeal to reformation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
               <p>Sometimes through ſelf-ends.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They zealouſly affect you, but not well. Yea, they would exclude us, that you might affect them, (ſaith the ſame Apoſtle,</hi> Gal. 4. 17.</p>
               <p>And ſometimes through envy.</p>
               <p>And ſo you ſee how the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> and the chief <hi>Prieſts</hi> under a fained zeal to their Law, Traditions, and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, perſecuted the ſaviour of the world.

               <p> For he believeth that he is one of thoſe for whom Chriſt died: Who gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a peculiar people, zealous of good works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. And is not Reformation a good work?</p>
               <p>Truely, I cannot deny, but it is a very good work. Yet as good as it is, it may be abuſed.</p>
               <p>It is moſt probable, that this was it, which <hi>Paul</hi> aimed at before his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When breathing out threatnings, and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt the Diſciples of the Lord, he went unto the High-prieſt, and deſired of him Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to</hi> Damaſcus <hi>to the Synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men, or women, he might bring them bound to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> Acts 9. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Lord</hi> proclaimed him a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that of no worſe a perſon then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: ſaying, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> verſe 5. whereas after his converſion, he chargeth the Corinthians, <hi>That all their things be done with charity,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 14. And to the <hi>Galatians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are ſpiritual, reſtore him with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of meekneſſe, conſidering thy ſelf, leaſt thou</hi>

               <p>The fifth <hi>Pretender,</hi> that layes claim to this inheritance is the <hi>Legal Profeſſour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And by him I intend ſuch a one, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth to be juſtified, and ſaved by his obedience unto the Law of <hi>God,</hi> expreſſed, or implied in the Moral Law, or the Law of the ten Commandments.</p>
               <p>And truely, you ſhall not meet with one ſenſible ſinner among many: But (appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending that he hath diſpleaſed <hi>God,</hi> by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:123675:66"/> that which is evil) he will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, but that the onely means to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled unto <hi>God,</hi> muſt be by repenting him of the evil, and by doing of that which is good.</p>
               <p>Albeit the Apoſtle telleth us: <hi>That we are reconciled to God by the death of his ſon,</hi> Rom. 5. 10.</p>
               <p>And therefore, in purſuance of that great miſtake, the way which commonly a Soul laden with ſin doth firſt light upon to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in the ſight of <hi>God,</hi> is the way of works. And this is ſometimes called, <hi>Our own righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 10. 3.</p>
               <p>As being performed, or at leaſt attempted of our ſelves, and by our ſelves.</p>
               <p>Sometimes it is called, <hi>The righteouſneſſe which is of the law,</hi> Rom. 10. 5.</p>
               <p>As conſiſting in the doing, or fulfilling of the Law. And ſometimes joyntly. <hi>Our own righteouſneſſe, which is of the law,</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> utterly diſclaimeth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
               <p>Now if a man ſhould weary himſelf in this way all his dayes: Yet (if he thinketh by that means to be juſtified in his life, or glorified at his death) he ſhall ſurely fail of his expectation. For firſt, our own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is worth nothing: Nay, it is worſe then nothing: <hi>All our righteouſneſſes are as filthy rags,</hi> Iſa. 64. 6.</p>
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:123675:66"/>
               <p> Secondly, the righteouſneſſe, which is of the Law is out of our reach. It requireth a perpetual, and a perfect obedience unto the whole Law of <hi>God,</hi> and that under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty of a curſe. <hi>For it is written: Curſed is every one, that continueth not in all things, that are written in the book of the Law, to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10.</p>
               <p>A yoake, which neither our Fathers nor we were able to bear, ſaith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 15. 10. in order to the fifth verſe of the ſame Chapter.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, our own righteouſneſſe, which is of the Law, croſſeth <hi>Gods</hi> deſigne in the matter of our juſtification, and ſalvation. <hi>For if righteouſneſſe come by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2. 21.</p>
               <p>And <hi>not by works of righteouſneſſe, which we have done, hut according to his mercy he ſaved us,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
               <p>And again, <hi>Chriſt is become of none effect unto you, whoſoever of you are juſtified by the law, ye are fallen from grace,</hi> Gal. 5. 4. But this legal profeſſour will alledge: That he believeth he can do nothing without <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and that it is, by, and for the power, and merits of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> that his good workes are made effectual, and acceptable in the ſight of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:123675:67"/>
               <p> Truely, there are many that have <hi>Chriſt</hi> much in their mouths. But they do not conſider rightly of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in their mindes. For, either they will have him to be onely an aſſiſtant unto them. Or elſe they doe verily ſuppoſe, that they muſt be aſſiſtants unto him.</p>
               <p>They that will have <hi>Chriſt</hi> rather for an aſſiſtant then a Saviour, are ſuch as ſeek to go to heaven upon their own legs: I mean for, and by their own righteouſneſſe; But finding an impoſſibility therein by reaſon of their manifold defects, they will onely bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſo much from <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as will make their own righteouſneſſe compleat. And to that purpoſe they weep; mourn, faſt, pray, and fall upon all the duties of piety and Religion, both towards <hi>God</hi> and man with much ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſſe and eagerneſſe. But perceiving themſelves, through the ſtrength of their corruptions, to fail, or miſcarry, they lay hold upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> to help them: otherwiſe they ſeldom, or never trouble him (more for his eaſe, then his honour) however, they ſatisfie themſelves with this perſwaſion, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> will fulfill that, wherein they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective: Whereby it appeareth that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they ſeem to call <hi>Chriſt</hi> to the main work, yet they take upon them to do
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:123675:67"/> the moſt work themſelves: Whereas the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle telleth us, that, <hi>To him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, his faith is counted for righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 4. 5.</p>
               <p>Theſe are they that will have <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be onely, an aſſiſtant unto them.</p>
               <p>They that will be aſſiſtants unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> in their juſtification and ſalvation, are ſuch, as do yet more confidently deny, or diſclaim their own legal righteouſneſſe. And yet if you ſhall examine their proceedings, you ſhall finde that they incline ſo much there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that they conceive they cannot be ſaved without it.</p>
               <p>They cannot be perſwaded, but they muſt do ſomething; though in truth to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: they muſt have at leaſt a finger (as we ſay) in their own ſalvation.</p>
               <p>They would indeed willingly follow <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but they cannot wholy deny them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Haply they will acknowledge <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be all, but not all in all. As if the bloud of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> could not cleanſe us from all ſin, contrary to that of St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 7. Or as if his righteouſneſſe were incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, <hi>In whom dwelleth all the fulneſſe of the god-head bodily,</hi> as ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Coll. 2. 9.</p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:123675:68"/>
               <p> Truely, this muſt needs be a great diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the <hi>Son of God,</hi> to patch his robe with our rags: his righteouſneſſe with our rotten corruptions. It muſt be the ſingle righteouſneſſe of one, and not the confuſed righteouſneſſe of two, or more compounded together that muſt juſtifie and ſave us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For if by one mans offence death reigned by one, much more they, which receive abundance of grace, and of the gift of righteouſneſſe, ſhall reign in life by one Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 17.</p>
               <p>But he will further alledge, that if our own works have no hand at all in our juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: To what purpoſe is that of Saint <hi>James? Was not</hi> Abraham <hi>our Father juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by works</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>when he had offered</hi> Iſaac <hi>his Son upon the Altar?</hi> James 2. 21.</p>
               <p>I anſwer that there is a juſtification of the perſon; and a juſtification of the Faith of the perſon. Now it appeareth plainly that the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> in that place, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the juſtification of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith: and not the juſtification of his perſon. For his perſon was juſtified at leaſt twenty years before. For is it not ſaid? <hi>That he believed in the Lord, &amp; he counted it to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> Gen. 15. 6.</p>
               <p>And that was before <hi>Abraham</hi> went in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:123675:68"/> unto <hi>Hagar:</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael, Abrahams</hi> ſon by <hi>Hagar,</hi> was thirteen years old when he was circumciſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 25.</p>
               <p>And that alſo was performed before <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac</hi> was begotten. And <hi>Iſaac</hi> going to be Offered, was able to carry the Wood, and to expoſtulate with his Father, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>So that by computation the perſon of <hi>A-Abraham</hi> was juſtified by Faith, no leſſe then twenty years, before his Faith was ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by Offering <hi>Iſaac</hi> his Son upon the Altar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Legal Profeſſour:</hi> In your actions, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations, a man may eaſily read your <hi>Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:</hi> Your <hi>Faith</hi> is built (not partly as you ſuppoſe) but wholy upon the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of workes: A decayed foundation. And not at all upon the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For you cannot relate to both Covenants, at one and the ſame time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſts</hi> work is perfect, therefore needs no help: ours is imperfect, therefore cannot help. And upon that account if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them: <hi>Chriſts</hi> work will be diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and blaſted: and ours will look moſt filthy and deformed. <hi>I have trodden the Wine-preſſe alone, and of the people there was none with me,</hi> ſaith our <hi>Lord,</hi> Iſa. 63. 3.</p>
               <p>And he that ſaid it: <hi>Is the Lord our righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi> Jer. 23. 6.</p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:123675:69"/>
               <p> And therefore learn by a lively Faith to lay hold upon the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (this <hi>Lord</hi> our righteouſneſſe) and to rely upon him wholy, and onely for your juſtification, and ſalvation: O verily, you get neither part nor portion in this eternal inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For by grace are ye ſaved through faith, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God: Not of works, leaſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi> As ſaith that Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>There are yet a confuſed company of Competitours (I know not how to call them) who do all pretend to this heavenly <hi>inheritance.</hi> But they differ as much in their fancies: as in their faces: and onely do agree in a general diſagreement. They cry out mightily againſt ſelfiſhneſſe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there ſeemeth to be little, or nothing elſe amongſt them. Their actions are ſelf-ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; their Allegations are ſelf-confuting: And their Evidences are ſelf-confounding.</p>
               <p>Whereupon it followeth, that they are more profitably ſeen then felt: heard, then beleeved: and rejected, then juſtified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They ſay, go to: let us build us a Citie, and a Tower, whoſe top may reach unto Heaven: that we may make us a name.</hi> In imitation of thoſe antike builders, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. 4.</p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:123675:69"/>
               <p> But the ſame <hi>God,</hi> that confounded the language of the one: doth likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the judgement of the other.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is very probable, that the Countrey, or Kingdom, which they ſhall inherit, and inhabit: will be called after the name of that Citie <hi>Babel:</hi> in plain Engliſh <hi>Confuſion.</hi> I dare not proceed any further in this diſcovery, leaſt I looſe my ſelf in a Wilderneſſe, full of wayes, both devious and dangerous.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſſe, and ſin againſt God,</hi> ſaith diſcreet, proſperous <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi> Gen. 39. 9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe he would prevent, or avoid correction: Not that he deſpiſeth, or diſliketh his heavenly fathers chaſtizement: But for as much as no chaſtening for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeemeth to be joyons, but grievous, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 11.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, leaſt he ſhould diſcontinue the favour, and defence of the Lord his Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour. <hi>Behold,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>the Lords hand is not ſhortened, that it cannot ſave, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is his ear heavy, that it cannot hear. But your iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God: and your ſins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear,</hi> Iſa. 59. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, he feareth to commit ſin, leaſt by that means he ſhould diminiſh his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his <hi>God:</hi> eſpecially, when he is to preſent himſelf before the <hi>Lord</hi> in prayer.</p>

               <p>And fifthly, leaſt thereby he ſhould bring diſhonour to his bleſſed Maſter. <hi>For if while we ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Furthermore, this <hi>loving believer</hi> is very frequent, and fervent in the exerciſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties: the duties of piety, and true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion: As hearing, reading, praying, prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and thankſ-giving, with the like godly imployments. Not that he expecteth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to deſerve, or obtain this eternal inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>But that by ſo doing, he may keep, and continue himſelf in a ſweet Communion with his <hi>God in Chriſt.</hi> For by hearing, and reading he findeth <hi>God</hi> ſpeaking unto him in his own language: whereby he wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully increaſeth, and improveth his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and acquaintance both with <hi>God</hi> and his will, untill <hi>the Holy Scriptures have made him wiſe unto ſalvation, through faith which is</hi>

                  <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> according to St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 15.</p>
               <p>By prayer and ſupplication he poureth out his Soul into the boſome of his heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father, unto whom he freely diſcovereth all his wants: humbly preſenteth all his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, and from whom he is alwayes ſure to receive a gracious anſwer, and a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table return. Haply not altogether accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own imperfect deſires: But more happily according to <hi>Gods</hi> moſt perfect wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and bounty: <hi>Who knoweth to give good things to them that ask him,</hi> Mat. 7. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And who giveth liberally to all men, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth not,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James,</hi> Ja. 1. 5.</p>
               <p>In praiſing God, firſt he preſenteth him with that, which of right belongeth unto him. <hi>The Lord is worthy to be praiſed,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 18. 3.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, he glorifieth <hi>God</hi> (the end for which he was created) <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who ſo offereth praiſe, glorifieth me,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord</hi> by his Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 23.</p>
               <p>And in giving thanks unto the <hi>Lord,</hi> he offereth up himſelf unto his <hi>God</hi> in a ſweet ſacrifice of retribution. <hi>I will praiſe the name of God with a ſong: and will magnifie him with thanksgiving: This alſo ſhall pleaſe the Lord better then an Ox, or Bullock, that</hi>

                  <hi>hath horns and hoofs,</hi> ſaith that ſweet ſinger, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 30, 31.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee that the life of this loving believer, is neither a ſluggiſh life; nor a ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh life, nor a ſinfull life, nor a ſolitary life.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is not a ſluggiſh life: <hi>For he is a veſſel unto honour, ſanctified, and meet for his Maſters uſe: and prepared unto every good work,</hi> as in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 21.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is not a ſlaviſh life: <hi>For he ſtandeth faſt in the liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made him free,</hi> as <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is not a ſinfull life: <hi>For how ſhall he, that is dead to ſin, live any longer therein,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 2.</p>
               <p>And fourthly, it is not a ſolitary life. For he hath continual Communion with his <hi>God: In whoſe preſence is fulneſſe of joy, and at whoſe right hand are pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 11.</p>
               <p>Now if you ask this <hi>loving believer,</hi> what he can alledge for himſelf in order to this title of inheritance. He will tell you, that he cannot finde any thing, either in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or any of his anteceſſours, that may promiſe him the leaſt poſſibility of intereſt therein. Neither hath he ſo much as one pennyworth, of any thing that is his own,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:123675:73"/> to offer towards the purchaſe of that Land of the living.</p>
               <p>Indeed, he underſtandeth that Originally it was conferred upon his Great-Grand-Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adam,</hi> and his Heirs in general, by God, that great, and onely diſpoſer of all things; upon condition of <hi>Adams</hi> obedience to the mind and will of his Maſter. But by his rebellion he forfeited his Coppy-hold, whereupon the Juſtice of <hi>God</hi> ejected him: and for ever utterly debarred, both himſelf and all his whole Poſterity from the capacity of a legal recovery.</p>
               <p>But he knoweth that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God</hi> hath purchaſed the Fee-ſimple of that inheritance, at the hands of his coeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Father:</hi> And hath promiſed a poſſeſſion therein to every one that believeth, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 47. and 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>And what he hath ſo promiſed, he hath alſo ſworn to perform.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For being willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the Heirs of promiſe the immutability of his Councel, he confirmed it by an Oath. That by two immutable things, in which it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for God to lie, we might have a ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us: which hope we have as an anchor of the Soul, both ſure &amp; ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:123675:73"/> 
                  <hi>and which entreth into that within the vail: whither the fore-runner is for us entred, even Ieſus made an High-Prieſt for ever, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the order of Melchiſedec,</hi> Heb. 6. 17, 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>And as for this <hi>believers evidence:</hi> It is a juſtifying, and a ſaving faith.</p>
               <p>And this he ſaith, is likewiſe the gift of <hi>God.</hi> According to that Apoſtles teſtimony, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 29.</p>
               <p>Now, if we ſhall apply our ſelves to the examination of this his <hi>evidence:</hi> It will be neceſſary for us to propound, and anſwer theſe five queſtions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, what is this juſtifying and ſaving faith?</item>
                  <item>Secondly, where, or in what place hath this faith its reſidence, or being?</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, upon what foundation muſt it be built?</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, how is it to be obtained?</item>
                  <item>And fifthly, how ſhall a man know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath this juſtifying and ſaving faith or not?</item>
               </list>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>FIrſt, therefore, if you ask what this ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying, and ſaving faith is? I anſwer: <hi>It is that gift of God, whereby we are inabled</hi>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:123675:74"/> 
                  <hi>to believe the promiſes of God in Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Goſpel: to repoſe, and reſt our ſelves confidently thereupon: and willingly, and cheerfully to receive the ſame God in Chriſt for our Saviour, and our Soveraign Lord.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it may be worth our pains to conſider this definition; according to ſix particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars therein contained.</p>
               <p>Firſt, this <hi>Faith</hi> is the gift of <hi>God.</hi> It is not in the power of any man to believe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, or ſavingly, except it be given him of God. <hi>To one is given by the Spirit the word of wiſdom, to another the word of knowledge by the ſame Spirit: To another Faith by the ſame Spirit,</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>And in another place: <hi>I ſay (through the grace given unto me) to every man that is among you, not to think more highly of himſelf, then he ought to think, but to think ſoberly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as God hath dealt to every man the meaſure of faith,</hi> Rom. 12. 3.</p>
               <p>And thus the <hi>Son of God</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There are ſome of you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not. For Jeſus knew from the beginning, who they were that believed not, and who ſhould betray him. And he ſaid, therefore ſaid I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father,</hi> John 6. 64, 65.</p>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:123675:74"/>
               <p> Secondly, by <hi>Faith</hi> we are inabled to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the promiſes of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is proved by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in the example of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Who againſt hope, believed in hope, that he might become the Father of many Nations, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which was ſpoken: So ſhall thy ſeed be. And being not weak in Faith, he conſidered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadneſſe of</hi> Saras <hi>womb. He ſtaggered not at the promiſe of God through unbelief: but was ſtrong in Faith, giving glory to God,</hi> Rom. 4. 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>And in the eleventh Chapter to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> we ſee how the Patriarchs, and other Saints of <hi>God,</hi> did believe, and adhere unto the promiſes of <hi>God</hi> by Faith, throughout that whole Chapter.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, faith inableth us to believe the promiſes of <hi>God in Chriſt:</hi> or, As <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf,</hi> as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
               <p>If we look upon <hi>God</hi> out of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> upon <hi>God</hi> eſſentially without a <hi>Mediatour:</hi> As he is <hi>a great God: a mighty and a terrible, which regardeth not perſons, nor taketh reward,</hi> as <hi>Deuter.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>As he is a conſuming fire, even a jelous God,</hi> as <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 24. <hi>who ſhall</hi>

                  <hi>bring every work into judgement,</hi> as <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And will by no means clear the gui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ty, Ex.</hi> 34. 7.</p>
               <p>I ſay, If we ſhall think upon God accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to theſe truths, we ſhall never dare to believe any promiſe that he hath made unto us for good: we ſhall rather believe, that he holdeth us for his enemies, &amp; that <hi>he writeth bitter things againſt us. Like patient</hi> Job <hi>in the extremity of his paſſions,</hi> Job 13. 24, 26. But if we ſhall conſider <hi>God,</hi> as he was in <hi>Chriſt</hi> reconciling the world unto himſelf, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting their treſpaſſes.</p>
               <p>Now we dare be bold to believe him: For we can aſſure our ſelves by <hi>Faith,</hi> that we are upon terms of peace, and that he hath received us into favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: By whom alſo we have acceſſe by faith into the grace wherein we ſtand, and rejoyce in hope of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 5. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>But haply you will ſay: How is it to be underſtood, <hi>That God was in Chriſt reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the world unto himſelf?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truely, this is a queſtion well worth the asking, and anſwering: For it is the great myſtery of the Goſpel, and that which but few do rightly underſtand.</p>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:123675:75"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>God was in Chriſt:</hi> That is, <hi>God</hi> did take unto himſelf the nature of man, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>God in Chriſt perſonally:</hi> that ſo he might reconcile the world unto himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill the ſame <hi>God eſſentially.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we would meditate upon <hi>God</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his acting or working, we muſt conceive of him, as one God in three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons diſtinctly: when we would conſider him according to his eſſence or being, we muſt conceive of him, as of three perſons in one <hi>God</hi> ſubſtantially and individually. So then, as <hi>God</hi> was reconciling the world, he was <hi>Deus cum Deo, God</hi> with <hi>God</hi> perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But as he was reconciling the world un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Himſelf.</hi> So he was <hi>Deus in Deo: God</hi> in <hi>God</hi> eſſentially.</p>
               <p>And thus <hi>God</hi> was in <hi>Chriſt</hi> divers wayes, or rather according to divers forms or kinds of adminiſtration: For whatſoever was concluded or done, either intentional<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, virtually or actually by the <hi>Son of God:</hi> as <hi>Mediatour</hi> for mankind;</p>
               <p>The ſame he did, as he was <hi>God in Chriſt.</hi> And therefore to paſſe by that infinite eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or being, of the three <hi>Perſons</hi> in the Godhead, according to their incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible co-exiſtency, as a ſecret too deep and intricate for the creature: And therefore
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:123675:76"/> not revealed unto us by the <hi>Creatour,</hi> either in his word, or works.</p>
               <p>We find that <hi>God</hi> was in <hi>Chriſt:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Covenant of Grace perſonally,</p>
               <p>In the Creation apparantly,</p>
               <p>In the Promiſe repreſentatively,</p>
               <p>In the ceremonial Law typically, or figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively,</p>
               <p>In his Incarnation perfectly and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly,</p>
               <p>In his Life obediently,</p>
               <p>In his death paſſively and patiently,</p>
               <p>In his Reſurrection victoriouſly,</p>
               <p>In his Aſcenſion triumphantly, And,</p>
               <p>In his Kingdom gloriouſly.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, <hi>God</hi> was in <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace</hi> perſonally: that is to ſay, in the ſecond perſon of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a remedy againſt that ruine, which he foreſaw mankind would run into by Satans malice, and their own rebellion. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Peter</hi> intimateth, <hi>That Chriſt was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordained for our redemption before the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world:</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Paul, That we are ſaved and called by God, according to his grace given us in Chriſt Jeſus before the world began,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 9.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> was the firſt ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall record that ever directed us to this perſonal diſtinction.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:123675:76"/>
               <p> Secondly, <hi>God</hi> was in <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion apparantly. For ſo St. <hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God: and the Word was God. The ſame was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made, that was made,</hi> John 1. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>If you ask what this <hi>Word</hi> was? I anſwer: <hi>The ſame Word that was afterward made fleſh: and dwelt amongſt us, and we beheld his glory; the glory as of the onely begotten of the Father: full of grace and truth,</hi> ſaith the ſame Evangeliſt, <hi>John</hi> 1. 14.</p>
               <p>You ſee here that <hi>God</hi> was in <hi>Chriſt</hi> at all the works of the creation: but more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly at the creation of mankinde. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And God ſaid, Let us make man,</hi> Gen. 1. 26. And verily it was according to the wiſdom of <hi>God,</hi> that his <hi>Son</hi> ſhould have a hand in the framing of that creature, upon whom he ſhould firſt beſtow his own image, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards take unto himſelf the others nature. That ſo the whole family of the faithfull might be made members of his body, of his fleſh, and of his bones for ever. According to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 30.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>God</hi> was in <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:123675:77"/> repreſentatively, he was repreſented in or by, <hi>the ſeed of the woman,</hi> Gen. 3. 15. And in or by <hi>the ſeed of Abraham,</hi> Gen. 22. 18. <hi>Now to Abraham and his ſeed were the promiſes made, he ſaith not, And to ſeeds as of many, but as of one; and to thy ſeed, which is Chriſt,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 3. 16.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>God</hi> was in <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law typically.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lamb</hi> for the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> Exod. 12. 3. <hi>did ſignifie the Lamb of God, which taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ſin of the world,</hi> Joh. 1. 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Ark of the Covenant,</hi> Numb. 10. 33. did typifie <hi>Jeſus the Mediatour of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> Heb. 12. 24. <hi>The prieſts, who were not ſuffered to continue, by reaſon of death,</hi> Heb. 7. 23. did perſonate <hi>this God in Chriſt, who becauſe he continueth ever, hath an unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able prieſthood,</hi> Hebr. 7. 24. <hi>The bloud of the ſin-offering,</hi> Levit. 16. 14. did repreſent <hi>the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt, which cleanſeth us from all ſin,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 7. In a word:</p>
               <p>All the ceremonies did ſet forth <hi>God in Chriſt,</hi> in ſome manner, or meaſure: in whom they all ceaſed, as the ſhadow in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. <hi>For they were the ſhadow of things to come: but the body is of Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2. 17.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>God</hi> was in <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perfectly and compleatly, according to
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:123675:77"/> both natures of <hi>God</hi> and Man in one perſon. As it appeareth both by <hi>propheſie, promiſe,</hi> and <hi>performance.</hi> Firſt, by propheſie: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, a virgin ſhall conceive and bear a ſon, and ſhall call his name Immanuel,</hi> Iſa. 7. 14. Secondly, by promiſe: <hi>The angel anſwered and ſaid unto Mary: The holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon thee, and the power of the moſt High ſhall overſhadow thee: therefore alſo that holy thing which ſhall be born of thee ſhall be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Son of God,</hi> Luke 1. 35. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by performance: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto you is born this day in the city of David, a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord:</hi> ſaith an angel unto the ſhepherds: <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 11, which they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found to be true, <hi>verſe</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>Now that this <hi>God in Chriſt</hi> was perfect <hi>God:</hi> it appeareth by that of the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was manifeſt in the fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, beleeved on in the world, received up into glory,</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 16.</p>
               <p>And as he was perfect <hi>God,</hi> ſo was he likewiſe perfect <hi>Man:</hi> and that according to his own infallible aſſurance. <hi>Handle me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and ſee, for a ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones, as ye ſee me have,</hi> Luke 24. 39.</p>
               <p>And if ſo after his reſurrection, without all doubt he had ſo before his death and buriall.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:123675:78"/>
               <p> Sixthly, <hi>God</hi> was in <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his life obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently. <hi>I ſeek not mine own will</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but the will of him that ſent me,</hi> Joh. 5. 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He became obedient unto death, even the death of the croſſe</hi> (that execrable death) <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>And thus the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by the things which he ſuffered: and being made perfect, he became the Authour of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſalvation, unto all them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>God</hi> was in <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his death paſſively, and patiently.</p>
               <p>When he breathed out his laſt groan up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the croſſe: <hi>The Centurion and they that were with him watching Jeſus, ſaid; Truly this was the Son of God,</hi> Matth. 27. 54.</p>
               <p>And thus the Apoſtle <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chriſt ſuffered for ſins, the juſt for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the fleſh, but quickened by the Spirit,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 18.</p>
               <p>And that he ſuffered patiently, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the ſame Apoſtle. <hi>Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps: who did no ſin, neither was guil found in his mouth. Who, when he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, reviled not again, when he ſuffered, he</hi>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:123675:78"/> 
                  <hi>threatened not, but committed himſelf to him that judgeth righteouſly,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 21, 22, 23.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, <hi>God</hi> was in <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection victoriouſly. <hi>For God raiſed him up, having looſed the pains of death: becauſe it was not poſſible that he ſhould be holden of it,</hi> Acts 2. 24. <hi>He hath aboliſhed death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Goſpel,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 10,</p>
               <p>And thus the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For as much then as the children are parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of fleſh and bloud, he alſo himſelf like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe took part of the ſame: that through death he might deſtroy him that had the power of death: that is the devil: And delivered them, who through fear of death, were all their life time ſubject to bondage,</hi> Heb. 2. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, <hi>God</hi> was in <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on triumphantly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When he aſcended up on high, he led capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity captive, and gave gifts to men,</hi> Eph. 4. 8.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, and laſtly, <hi>God</hi> is in <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his kingdom gloriouſly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Where the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of glory,</hi> &amp;c. Epheſ. 1. 17. <hi>hath ſet him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not onely in this world, but alſo in</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:123675:79"/> 
                  <hi>that which is to come,</hi> &amp;c. Epheſ. 1. 20, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now albeit theſe ſeveral forms or kinds of adminiſtration, conformable to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral times and occaſions, ordained by <hi>Gods</hi> unconceiveable wiſdom, may peradventure beget ſome thoughts of alteration, in our weak apprehenſions: yet this <hi>God in Chriſt,</hi> neither was, is, nor ſhall be, any other, than what was concluded and agreed upon, in and by that eternal <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He is Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13. 8.</p>
               <p>Yeſterday, before the time of mans tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral being: to day, in the time of mans temporal being: And for ever, during the time of mans temporal being. And whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this <hi>God in Chriſt</hi> either purpoſed, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, did, or ſuffred from everlaſting to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting; it was, and is all in purſuance of that great deſigne of reconciling the world unto himſelf.</p>
               <p>In which he ſhall perſiſt, and perſevere, until the laſt and general diſſolution, when there ſhall be no more uſe of a <hi>Mediatour:</hi> And then the <hi>Son of God</hi> ſhall deliver up the kingdom of his Mediatourſhip to <hi>God,</hi> even the <hi>Father:</hi> and ſhall ceaſe to be <hi>God in Chriſt</hi> perſonally, that <hi>God</hi> may be all in all eſſentially. According to that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 28.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:123675:79"/>
               <p> Thus you ſee (in ſome meaſure) how it may be underſtood: That <hi>God</hi> was in <hi>Chriſt</hi> reconciling the world unto himſelf.</p>
               <p>And now we come to prove the fourth particular contained in this definition of faith. That this juſtifying faith inableth us to believe the promiſes of <hi>God in Chriſt,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not according to the <hi>law: For the law is not of faith,</hi> Gal. 3. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For if there had been a law given, which could have given life, verily righteouſneſſe ſhould have been by the law. But the Scripture hath concluded all under ſin, that the promiſe by faith of Ieſus Chriſt might be given to them that believe,</hi> Gal. 3. 21, 22.</p>
               <p>And no man ought to doubt, but that the promiſe of the grace of <hi>God in Chriſt</hi> is the onely voice of the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> whether it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the Apoſtles, or from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets: And therefore it is called <hi>the Goſpel of the grace of God,</hi> Acts 20. 24.</p>
               <p>And <hi>the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 1. 16.</p>
               <p>And that this juſtifying, and ſaving faith inableth us to believe the promiſes of <hi>God in Chriſt:</hi> According to his Goſpel, it is moſt evident: For neither can faith juſtifie, or ſave us without the Goſpel, neither can the Goſpel juſtifie, or ſave us without faith:
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:123675:80"/> And to this purpoſe faith is called, <hi>The faith of the Goſpel,</hi> Phil. 1. 27.</p>
               <p>And the Goſpel is called, <hi>The word of faith,</hi> Rom. 10. 8. Neither is this Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to any time, place, or perſon: but was, is, and ſhall be effectual through faith to all believers in all ages for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Scripture foreſeeing, that God would juſtifie the Heathen through faith, preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Goſpel unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
               <p>And <hi>it is the power of God unto ſalvation to every one that believeth: to the</hi> Jew <hi>firſt, and alſo to the</hi> Greek, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 16.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Faith inableth us to reſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelves confidently upon the ſaid promiſes of <hi>God in Chriſt:</hi> Not onely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, but alſo to reſt, and rely upon them. Every true believer can affirm that freely, which <hi>Balaam</hi> the wizard was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to teſtifie in ſpight of his own teeth. <hi>God is not a man that he ſhould lie, neither the Son of man, that he ſhould repent: hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it? or hath he ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſhall he not make it good?</hi> Num. 23. 19. <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iob) that my Redeemer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin, worms deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God: whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:123675:80"/> 
                  <hi>mine eyes ſhall behold, and not another, though my reins be conſumed within me,</hi> Job 19. 25. 26, 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lo, we have left all, and followed thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> unto Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 28.</p>
               <p>We have left all the poſſibilities of this World, and depended wholy upon thee, and thy promiſes. <hi>I am not aſhamed of my ſufferings</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) for I know whom I have believed, and I am perſwaded, that he is able to keep that, which I have committed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him againſt that day,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am perſwaded</hi> (ſaith the ſame Apoſtle) <hi>that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, nor heighth, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord,</hi> Rom. 8. 38, 39.</p>
               <p>And very much to this purpoſe is that of <hi>Iohn the Baptiſt,</hi> concerning faith in <hi>Chriſt: He that hath received his Teſtimony</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath ſet to his Seal that God is true,</hi> Joh. 3. 33. That is, he that by the hand of a lively faith, hath received the Teſtimony of <hi>God in Chriſt,</hi> concerning the promiſes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel: he hath ſet to his Seal that <hi>God</hi> is true in all thoſe promiſes: He hath not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witneſſed it with his mouth, or ſubſcribed
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:123675:81"/> unto it with his hand: But he hath ſet to his Seal, which is an argument of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt aſſurance that may be.</p>
               <p>Verily the ſeveral deportments, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviours of the Patriarchs, Prophets, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, Martyrs, and generally of all the faithfull in all ages, even to this preſent hour, will abundantly teſtifie the truth of this particular: If we ſhall look back upon their doings and ſufferings, but any thing ſeriouſly, unto all which they were wholy induced, and incouraged by the aſſured hope of eternal life, which <hi>God that cannot lye, promiſed before the world began,</hi> Tit. 1. 2. <hi>For if in this life onely they had hope in Chriſt, they had been of all men moſt miſerable.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 19.</p>
               <p>The ſixth, and laſt particular belonging to this definition of faith, is this: That it inableth us to receive the <hi>Lord Ieſus Chriſt, or God in Chriſt,</hi> for our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and our <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord:</hi> Firſt for our <hi>Saviour, when many more of the Samaritans believed, becauſe of Chriſts own word. They ſaid unto the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, now we believe, not becauſe of thy ſaying, but we have heard him our ſelves, and know, that this is indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the world,</hi> Joh. 4. 41, 42.</p>
               <p>Thus when the <hi>Lord</hi> beginneth to incline
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:123675:81"/> the Soul to liſten after <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> He firſt preſents him as a Saviour: As being the moſt acceptable object to a diſtreſſed conſcience: who apprehending her own curſed conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by reaſon of ſin, and the Juſtice of God againſt ſin, armed with no gentler weapons, then all manner of temporal calamities, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with eternal death and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The poor blinde Soul ſits now down in the darkneſſe of ſorrow and diſcomfort, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring relief, or direction to relief. Like blinde <hi>Bartimeus,</hi> who ſate at the high-wayes ſide begging, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 46.</p>
               <p>In this perplexity <hi>Gods holy Spirit</hi> whiſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, and revealeth, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Saviour</hi> is at hand to help her. Hereupon (with the ſame blinde man) ſhe beginneth to cry out, <hi>Ieſus thou Son of David have mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y on me.</hi> And being charged by the Devil, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, to hold her peace: ſhe crieth the more a great deal. <hi>Thou Son of David have mercie on me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To whoſe ſad cries the <hi>Saviour</hi> attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and ſendeth faith to call her: Faith ſaith unto her, <hi>be of good comfort, ariſe, he calleth thee.</hi> At this the cheerfull Soul caſts off her Garment: <hi>The rags of her own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe;</hi> and riſeth, and cometh unto <hi>Ieſus, Ieſus</hi> ſaith unto her, <hi>what wilt thou that I</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:123675:82"/> 
                  <hi>ſhould do unto thee?</hi> The ſoul replieth; <hi>Lord, that I may receive my ſight:</hi> So much ſight, as that I may cleerly ſee thee to be my <hi>Saviour. Jeſus</hi> ſaith unto her, <hi>Thy faith hath ſaved thee.</hi> And immediately ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth ſight, and denieth her ſelf, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth up her croſſe, and followeth him; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her Saviours own direction, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 34.</p>
               <p>By this you may perceive, that faith doth firſt ſet us on work to receive <hi>Chriſt</hi> for our <hi>Saviour</hi> or <hi>Redeemer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet this is no infallible property of a juſtifying and a ſaving faith. For there is ſcarce any reprobate whatſoever (under the colour of a Chriſtian) but is ſometimes wounded by the ſting of an evil conſcience, and terrified with the ſenſe of <hi>Gods</hi> heavie wrath and indignation: And in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate fit, he will be ready even to rore out upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> to become his <hi>Saviour.</hi> But if our faith be right, if it be effectuall, it will alſo carry us on to receive and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace <hi>Chriſt</hi> for our onely <hi>Lord and Maſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye call me Maſter, and Lord, and ye ſay well: for ſo I am,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>John</hi> 13. 13. So I am to every true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever.</p>
               <p>We read that when the reſt of the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:123675:82"/> had told <hi>Thomas</hi> (called <hi>Didimus)</hi> that they had ſeen the <hi>Lord,</hi> after his reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; <hi>Thomas ſaid, Except I ſhall ſee in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails: and thruſt my hand into his ſide, I will not beleeve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After eight dayes <hi>Jeſus</hi> appeared again unto his diſciples, <hi>Thomas alſo being then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them.</hi> Then ſaid he to <hi>Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold my hands, and reach hither thy hand, and thruſt it into my ſide, and be not faithleſſe, but beleeving.</hi> And no ſooner had <hi>Thomas,</hi> by this means, arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto the full aſſurance of faith; but immediately he anſwered, and ſaid unto him: <hi>My Lord, and my God,</hi> John 20. 28. He ſaith not, Thou art <hi>Chriſt the Son of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God,</hi> according to <hi>Peters</hi> former ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, <hi>John</hi> 6. 69. But, <hi>Thou art my Lord, and my God.</hi> Intimating thereby, that all his ſervice, obedience, worſhip, and reverence, wholly and onely unto him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed.</p>
               <p>And ſo likewiſe <hi>Saul,</hi> afterwards <hi>Paul,</hi> at firſt a perſecutour, and injurious to the name of <hi>Jeſus.</hi> But even in the heat of his haſte and fury, the ſame <hi>Son of God</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts him, and beats him off from his barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous enterpriſe, who thereupon perceiving
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:123675:83"/> 
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be far otherwiſe than what he had formerly conceived: <hi>He trembling and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſaid, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Acts 9. 6. As if he had ſaid: <hi>Lord,</hi> the word of thy mouth, being the ſword of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> hath both convinced, and converced me. Now I beleeve thee to be the ſame, that thy bleſſed diſciples have declared: I am overcome by thy power, and now I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thine imployment: <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have to do?</hi> And what he was afterwards commanded, he moſt happily performed: doing and ſuffering for the truth of the Goſpel, more, and with more willingneſſe and cheerfulneſſe, than ever any man, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept his <hi>Maſter.</hi> Inſomuch, that he trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed in his ſufferings, ſaying, <hi>I take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in infirmities, in reproaches, in neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, in perſecutions, in diſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 10.</p>
               <p>Thus faith, when it is effectual, draweth us unto, and into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> enabling us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, not only for our <hi>Saviour,</hi> but alſo for our <hi>Sovereigne;</hi> our chief and onely <hi>Lord.</hi> Not onely to ſave our ſouls, but alſo to love, honour, and obey him, as the onely <hi>Saviour</hi> of our ſouls: and that willingly and cheerfully. <hi>For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi>

               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:123675:84"/>
               <p> The ſecond queſtion to be anſwered in this diſcovery of <hi>Faith,</hi> in order to the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the <hi>Beleevers evidence</hi> is this.</p>
               <p>Where, or in what part hath this ſaving Faith its reſidence, or being?</p>
               <p>I anſwer; In the heart. For ſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle: <hi>With the heart man beleeveth unto righteouſneſſe,</hi> Rom. 10. 10. Not in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion: For the ſame Apoſtle ſaith concerning the defiled, and unbeleeving. <hi>They profeſſe that they know God: but in works they deny him, being abominable, and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and to every good work reprobate,</hi> Tit. 1. 16.</p>
               <p>We have two notable examples of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſion, and inward hypocriſie in the new Teſtament. The one of <hi>Judas Iſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot;</hi> we find that he was one of <hi>Chriſts</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, one of twelve: That his Lord ſent him forth with the reſt, to preach, and to work miracles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. to 9. Neither do we find any thing to the contrary, but that he performed his duty according to his Commiſſion.</p>
               <p>And in matter of charity to the poor, he ſeemed to exceed all the reſt. For when <hi>Mary</hi> anointed the feet of her <hi>Saviour</hi> with that coſtly ointment, <hi>Iohn</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Why was not this ointment ſold for three hundred pence</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:123675:84"/> (ſaith this <hi>Iudas) and given to the poor?</hi> verſe 5. Can any <hi>Iudas</hi> now breathing counterfeit a fairer colour?</p>
               <p>But nevertheleſſe, the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth him for a covetous hypocrite. <hi>For this he ſaid, not that he cared for the poor: but becauſe he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein,</hi> verſe 6. Of whom the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> further teſtifieth. ſaying, <hi>He was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this miniſtery: yet this man purchaſed a field with the reward of iniquity, and falling headlong, he burſt aſunder in the midſt, and all his bowels guſhed out. And it was known to all the dwellers at Ieruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. Acts 1. 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Thus was his treacherous heart diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and rewarded; who, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the doctrine, miracles, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall converſation of the <hi>Son of God</hi> affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him the ſame outward means of faith and fidelity with the reſt of the Apoſtles: yet in his heart he was ſo far from belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, loving, and obeying his bleſſed <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter,</hi> that he ſold him for a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible price, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 15. Betrayed him with a villanous kiſſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 49. And afterwards hanged himſelf in a devilliſh deſpair, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. 5.</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:123675:85"/>
               <p> The other example is that of <hi>Simon</hi> the ſorcerer, whom we commonly call <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> who at firſt bewitched the people of <hi>Samaria</hi> with his ſorceries.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But when they beleeved Philip, preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Ieſus Chriſt, they were baptized both men and women. Then Simon himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved alſo, and when he was baptized, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with Philip. and wondered, beholding the miracles and ſignes which were done,</hi> Acts 8. 9, to 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And when Simon ſaw, that through laying on of the Apoſtles hands, the holy Ghoſt was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: he offered them money, ſaying, Give me alſo this power, that on whomſoever I lay hands, he may receive the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 8. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Now let us lay all theſe together. He beleeved, and was baptized, and continued with his teacher; and was ſo deſirous of the gift of the holy <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> that he would have bought it with his money (a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity that few will part with, upon ſuch terms) and what can any man deſire more? Yet <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid unto him, <hi>Thy money periſh with thee: becauſe thou haſt thought that the gift of God may be purchaſed with money. Thou haſt neither part nor lot in this matter.</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:123675:85"/> 
                  <hi>For thy heart is not right in the ſight of God,</hi> Acts 8. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>Truely, according to the outward ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, this <hi>Simon</hi> the ſorcerer performed as much as might be expected; and yet we ſee, that all was to no purpoſe: becauſe his <hi>heart</hi> was not right in the ſight of <hi>God.</hi> It is like that his evil heart propounded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him this outward profeſſion, for the only means to compaſſe his carnal deſignes. And this will the rather appear by <hi>Peters</hi> inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exhortation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Repent therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of this thy wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, and pray to God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee: for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe, and in the bond of iniquity,</hi> Acts 8. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>Truely, theſe examples may ſerve for ſeaſonable admonitions to ſuch as make uſe of religion onely, as a fig-leafe to cover their ſhame: or to countenance their cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, cruelties, or confederacies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Keep thine heart with all diligence</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon) for out of it are the iſſues of life:</hi> Prov. 4. 23. Out of the heart are the iſſues of life, or the wayes of life: yea, and of death too. <hi>A good man, out of the good trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the heart, bringeth forth good things:</hi>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:123675:86"/> 
                  <hi>and an evil man out of the evil treaſure bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for evil things,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Son of God,</hi> Mat. 12. 30.</p>
               <p>And as he knew all mens hearts, ſo we finde that he diſtinguiſhed between the Hypocrite, and the true believer, by the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye Hypocrites</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>well did</hi> Eſaias <hi>propheſie of you, ſaying, This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me,</hi> Mat. 15. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>To confirm and conclude this truth, that the heart is the onely receptacle, or place of reſidence for an effectual faith: I pray ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, That when the <hi>Eunuch</hi> made the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Philip</hi> of being baptized: <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid, <hi>if thou believeſt with all thine heart, thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi> Acts 8. 36, 37.</p>
               <p>Haply he remembred the Sorcerers evil heart, whom he had then but lately bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: and fearing, leaſt this <hi>Eunuch</hi> might be poyſoned with the like Hypocriſie, and ſo become lyable to the like reproof: he telleth him that he may be baptized; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that he believeth with all his <hi>heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truely, this is not without great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the <hi>heart</hi> ſhould be principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded in matter of <hi>faith.</hi> For firſt, <hi>God</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:123675:86"/> ſendeth faith into the heart to purge, and purifie it, as <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 9. And faith bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Chriſt</hi> into the ſame heart along with it. According to that prayer of <hi>Paul</hi> for the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſians,</hi> Eph. 3. 17. which ſeemeth likewiſe to be moſt ſweetly inſinuated, by the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving love-ſick ſpouſe. <hi>I found him, whom my Soul loveth</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>I held him, and would not let him go, untill I had brought him into my mothers houſe, and into the Chamber of her that conceived me,</hi> Cant. 3. 4.</p>
               <p>And when the gracious Soul hath thus brought <hi>Chriſt</hi> to dwell in her heart by faith; then ſhe beginneth to rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 8.</p>
               <p>But whereupon muſt this faith be built? For that is the third Queſtion.</p>
               <p>I anſwer that, it muſt be built upon the Rock, which is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 4.</p>
               <p>Not upon <hi>Thoughts,</hi> or <hi>Opinions,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not upon <hi>Traditions,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not upon <hi>Humane Inventions,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not upon <hi>Dreams,</hi> or <hi>Fancies,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not upon <hi>Propheſies,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not upon <hi>Prognoſtications,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not upon <hi>Wreſted Expoſitions,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not upon <hi>Works of Righteouſneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But upon <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſſe,</hi> Jer. 23. 6.</p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:123675:87"/>
               <p> Firſt, a juſtifying faith muſt not be built upon <hi>Thoughts,</hi> or <hi>Opinions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For <hi>the Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wiſe, that they are but vain,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I verily thought with my ſelf</hi> (or I was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly of opinion) <hi>that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jeſus,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 26. 9. But that opinion of his made him a perſecuter, and not a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.</p>
               <p>Secondly, not upon Traditions: <hi>Beware, leaſt any man ſpoil you through philoſophy, and vain deceit, after the Traditions of men, and not after Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>And our <hi>Saviour</hi> told the <hi>Scribes</hi> &amp; <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,</hi> that they <hi>tranſgreſſed the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God by their Traditions,</hi> Mat. 15. 3.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, not upon <hi>humane inventions: They are whores</hi> (deceitfull whores) as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David</hi> inſinuateth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106. 39.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For therefore was the wrath of God kindled againſt his people, inſomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance,</hi> verſe 40.</p>
               <p>Curſed are they that father their own adulterous conceptions upon the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> or that dare forge a Goſpel according to their own <hi>inventions. If we, or an Angel from heaven preach any other Goſpel unto you,</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:123675:87"/> 
                  <hi>then that, which we have preached, let him be accurſed,</hi> ſaith that faithfull Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For we preach not our ſelves, but Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus the Lord, and our ſelves your ſervants for Jeſus ſake,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this faith muſt not be built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Dreams,</hi> or <hi>Fancies. For in the multitude of Dreams, and many w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rds, there are alſo divers vanities,</hi> ſaith the Preacher, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>I have</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Lord) heard, what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſaid, that propheſie lies in my name, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have dreamed, I have dreamed,</hi> Jer. 23. 25.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, not upon <hi>propheſies: The Prophets propheſie falſly,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord,</hi> Jer. 5. 31. we finde that for one <hi>Elijah,</hi> there were four hundred and fifty Prophets of <hi>Baal,</hi> 1 Kings 18. 22. And for one <hi>Micaiah,</hi> about four hundred lying Prophets, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 23. Truely, in compariſon of the multitudes of lying Prophets: there were but very few, that were approved to be true &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, even then under the ſhadows of the Law: when propheſying was very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to declare the will of <hi>God,</hi> and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the mindes of men in the promiſed <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:123675:88"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>But God, who at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpake in time paſt unto the fathers by the Prophets: hath in theſe laſt dayes ſpoken unto us by his Son,</hi> Heb. 1. 1, 2. And it may ſeem that <hi>Peter</hi> deſired to have conference with thoſe great Prophets <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias:</hi> But behold, a voice out of the Cloud, which ſaid, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed: hear ye him,</hi> Mat. 17. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Verily, they that groape after propheſies in the bright ſun-ſhine of the Goſpel: <hi>They walk after the light of their own fire, and in the ſparks, that they themſelves have kindled: This ſhall they have of mine hand</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Lord) they ſhall lie down in ſorrow,</hi> Iſa. 50. 11.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, we are not to build our faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Prognoſtications. A Diviner, an ol ſerver of times, a Charmer, a Wizard, or a Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with familiar Spirits, all that do theſe things are an abomination unto the Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> from the mouth of the <hi>Lord,</hi> Deut. 18. 22.</p>
               <p>It is a wonder, how they come to be of ſuch reputation with us, that dare profeſſe a zeal to <hi>Gods</hi> glory? Is it not juſt with our <hi>God</hi> to ſay unto <hi>England,</hi> as ſometime he ſaid unto <hi>Babilon? Let now the Aſtrologers, the Star-gazers, the monethly Prognoſticatours</hi>
                  <pb n="163" facs="tcp:123675:88"/> 
                  <hi>ſtand up, and ſave thee from thoſe things, that ſhall come upon thee: Behold, they ſhall be as ſtubble, the fire ſhall burn them, they ſhall not deliver themſelves from the power of the flame,</hi> Iſa. 47. 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, not upon <hi>wreſted Expoſitions: There are ſomethings in the Scriptures hard to be underſtood, which they that are unlearned, and unſtable, do wreſt to their own deſtruction,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 16.</p>
               <p>And eightly, a juſtifying and ſaving faith cannot be built upon the <hi>works of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: For not by the works of righteouſneſſe that we have done; but according to his mercy he ſaved us,</hi> Tit. 3. 5.</p>
               <p>Theſe works of righteouſneſſe are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the works of the Law: <hi>But by the works of the law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified,</hi> Gal. 2. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For if righteouſneſſe come by the law, then Chriſt is dead in vain,</hi> Gal. 2. 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is the ſtone which was ſet at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter</hi> to the rulers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the Elders of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Acts 4. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Neither is there ſalvation in any other,</hi> verſe 12.</p>
               <p>How often doth the <hi>Son of God</hi> cry out upon us in his holy Goſpel; to believe on
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:123675:89"/> him, to believe in him. To believe on his name, to believe in his Merits and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the regenerate Jaylor. <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved,</hi> Acts 16. 31. And in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians: Though I be abſent in the fleſh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>yet am I with you in the ſpirit, joying, and beholding your order, and the ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſſe of your faith in Chriſt,</hi> Col. 2. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As ye have therefore received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſo walk ye in him, rooted, and built up in him, and eſtabliſhed in the faith, abounding therein with thanks-giving,</hi> verſe 6. 7.</p>
               <p>I pray obſerve, as ye have received <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Lord</hi> by the hand of <hi>faith:</hi> ſo walk in him according to the righteouſneſſe of <hi>faith,</hi> rooted in him by the word of <hi>faith,</hi> and built up in him by the work of <hi>faith,</hi> and eſtabliſhed in the <hi>faith,</hi> by him the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour,</hi> and <hi>finiſher</hi> of your <hi>faith,</hi> abounding in the fruit of <hi>faith,</hi> with thankſ-giving the evidence of <hi>faith.</hi> See here how ſweetly this Apoſtle inſinuateth unto us, how we are to proceed in the degrees of <hi>faith,</hi> and that according to the rule of <hi>faith,</hi> even the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of <hi>Chriſt: For it is the power of God unto ſalvation, unto every one that believeth. For</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:123675:89"/> 
                  <hi>therein is the righteouſneſſe of God revealed from faith to faith,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, Rom. 1. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Not from one kinde of <hi>faith</hi> to another, but from one degree of <hi>faith</hi> to another.</p>
               <p>And to conclude this point, I am more then confident, that there did never any precept nor principle proceed, either from the <hi>Son of God</hi> himſelf, or from any of his Apoſtles, that may direct us to any other foundation for our <hi>faith:</hi> but onely <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the promiſes of the Goſpel: all which are the very ſame in ſubſtance, and do clearly hold forth unto us this <hi>God in Chriſt,</hi> reconciling the world unto himſelf. <hi>And to him give all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets witneſſe, that through his name, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins,</hi> Acts 10. 43. And therefore moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed is he, that ſhall wilfully endeavour to ſubvert this ground-work, or to make it a ſtumbling ſtone, or a Rock of offence, to any Soul, by any means, or upon any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whatſoever. <hi>For other foundation can no man lay, then that is laid, which is Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 11.</p>
               <p>We come now to the fourth general Queſtion.</p>
               <p>How, or by what means, is this faith ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained?
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:123675:90"/> It is anſwered, that faith is obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the hearing of the word of God: For ſo St. <hi>Paul. Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God,</hi> Rom. 10. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live,</hi> ſaith that <hi>Son of God</hi> himſelf, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 25.</p>
               <p>The dead, ſuch as are <hi>dead in treſpaſſes, and ſins,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 1. They ſhall hear the voice of the <hi>Son of God:</hi> the voice of his Goſpel from the mouths of his Miniſters, his Ambaſſadours, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20.</p>
               <p>And they that hear ſhall live; live by faith: <hi>The life that I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20.</p>
               <p>And by faith they ſhall live: <hi>The juſt ſhall live by faith,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 11.</p>
               <p>But you may ſay, that I have already proved in my definition of faith, that faith is the gift of <hi>God:</hi> how then is it obtained by hearing? It is moſt true, that faith is the gift of <hi>God.</hi> Nevertheleſſe, he holdeth it forth unto us in the means; and that is the word.</p>
               <p>Shall <hi>God</hi> give us his word, and ſhall not we give him the hearing of it?</p>
               <p>We read, that ſuch as gladly received the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:123675:90"/> word from the mouth of <hi>Peter,</hi> were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: <hi>and there were added the ſame day unto the believers about three thouſand Souls,</hi> Acts 2. 41.</p>
               <p>And not long after, <hi>many of them which heard the word, believed: and the number of the men were five thouſand,</hi> Acts 4. 4.</p>
               <p>But ſuch as believed without hearing: I do not remember; that ever I did read of any. I will not ſeem to reſtrain the power of <hi>God: For with God all things are poſſible, Mar.</hi> 10. 27. But according to mans appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeems to make it a thing impoſſible for a man to believe without hearing. <hi>How ſhall they beleeve in him of whom they have not heard?</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14.</p>
               <p>But as we believe not without hearing, ſo neither do we believe by hearing onely without the bleſſing of <hi>God</hi> thereupon.</p>
               <p>And in reference hereunto faith is moſt properly called the gift of <hi>God.</hi> It was the <hi>Lord</hi> that opened the heart of <hi>Lidia:</hi> that ſhe attended unto the things, which were ſpoken by <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 16. 14. It is man that preacheth, but it is <hi>God</hi> that teacheth. <hi>It is written in the Prophets</hi> (ſaith our <hi>Saviour) And they ſhall be all taught of God: Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath</hi>

                  <hi>learned of the father, cometh unto me,</hi> John 6. 45.</p>
               <p>Now to come unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to believe in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> do ſignifie the ſame thing, as may eaſily be obſerved out of the 64. and 65. verſes of the ſame 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>John,</hi> and likewiſe out of the 37. and 38. verſes of the Chapter next following.</p>
               <p>I pray obſerve alſo from hence, that if you will have faith, you muſt ſo hear from man, that you may learn of <hi>God.</hi> And for our better direction herein, the <hi>Son of God</hi> hath left us theſe two Cautions. <hi>Take heed what ye hear,</hi> Mar. 4. 24.</p>
               <p>And, <hi>Take heed how ye hear,</hi> Luke 8. 18.</p>
               <p>Firſt, take heed what ye hear: <hi>Be not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with divers and ſtrange Doctrines,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>For the time will come, when they will not endure ſound Doctrine, but after their own luſts ſhall they heap to themſelves Teachers, having itching ears: and they ſhall turn away their ears from the truth, and ſhall be turned unto fables,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alſo of your own ſelves ſhall men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things to draw Diſciples af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Ac.</hi> 20. 30.</p>
               <p>But haply you will ſay: If there be ſuch danger in what we hear, it were better for
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:123675:91"/> us wholy to abſent our ſelves, and not to hear any man at all.</p>
               <p>O no: Do not ſo neither, do not utterly rob and ſpoyl your ſelves of the <hi>Truth,</hi> upon ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of being led into errour.</p>
               <p>This would be as if a man ſhould put out his own eyes, leaſt another man ſhould ſtand between him and the light.</p>
               <p>Or, as if a man ſhould kill himſelf, for fear another man ſhould hurt him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that hath eares to hear, let him hear.</hi> This was our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviours cry,</hi> Luke 8. 8.</p>
               <p>But that you may know, how to take heed what you hear: So, as that you may hear with the leſſe prejudice, and the greater comfort, and aſſurance: we will deſcend through this general rule, into ſome few particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, take heed what you hear, that may haſard your modeſty, or good manners in the ſearch of <hi>Gods</hi> hidden ſecrets. <hi>For the ſecret things belong unto the Lord our God: but thoſe things that are revealed belong unto us, and to our Children for ever,</hi> Deut. 29. 29.</p>
               <p>Secondly, take heed what you hear, that may withdraw, or diſcourage you from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the revealed will of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For if any man will do his will, he ſhall</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:123675:92"/> 
                  <hi>know of the Doctrine, whither it be of God,</hi> John 7. 17.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, take heed what you hear to the diſhonour of <hi>God,</hi> either in the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> or <hi>Trinity,</hi> eſpecially againſt the holy <hi>Ghoſt. For whoſoever ſpeaketh againſt the holy Ghoſt: It ſhall n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fourthly, take heed what you hear, that may make againſt your <hi>Election</hi> by the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Eph. 1. 3, 4, 5. or againſt your <hi>Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> by the <hi>Son,</hi> Col. 1. 14. Or againſt your <hi>Sanctification</hi> by the holy <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 15. 16.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, take heed what you hear, that may contradict the lawfull uſe of the Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Law is good, if a man uſe it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 8.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, take heed what you hear, that may obſtruct the liberty of the Goſpel. It is called: <hi>The perfect law of liberty,</hi> Ja. 1. 15. Provided, that it be not <hi>uſed for an occaſion to the fleſh:</hi> According to that Caveat, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 13.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, take heed what ye hear in the defence, or toleration of ſin, either Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, actual, or intentional.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the wages of ſin is death,</hi> Rom. 6. 23.</p>
               <p>Eightly, take heed what you hear, that may aſcribe that unto the fleſh, which is
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:123675:92"/> properly the work of the <hi>ſpirit:</hi> As free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, univerſal grace, or the like Divine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations, or indowments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do, of his good pleaſure,</hi> Phil. 2. 13.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, take heed what you hear, to the reproach or prejudice of any particular perſon whatſoever, whether he be ſaint, or ſinner, or preſent or abſent: or of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular calling ordained of <hi>God,</hi> or approved by good authority: This ſavoureth of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie. <hi>And where envying and ſtrife is, there is confuſion, and every evil work:</hi> James 3. 16. Or at leaſt, it argueth uncharitableneſſe: <hi>And though a man ſpeaketh with the tongues of men and angels, and hath not charity: he is but as ſounding braſſe, or a tinckling cymbal:</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 1. ſin muſt be reproved, but the perſon may not be reproached.</p>
               <p>Tenthly, take heed what you hear to the rejection, or the corruption, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, or the diſparagement of the word of God, otherwiſe called the holy Scriptures.</p>

                  <item>Thirdly, it is the <hi>word of ſalvation,</hi> Acts 13. 26. <hi>Able to make a man wiſe unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 15.</item>

                  <item> And fourthly, it is the <hi>good word of God,</hi> Heb. 6. 5. And he that beleeveth not <hi>God,</hi> hath done him ſuch infinite diſhonour, as to make him a liar, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 10.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But I conceive there may be many in our dayes, that will be ready to ſay; What needs all this warning? So long as we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>Spirit of truth,</hi> he will guide us into all <hi>truth.</hi> True: ſo long as we follow the <hi>Spirit of truth.</hi> But we muſt know, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, or contrary to the <hi>Spirit of truth,</hi> there are <hi>ſeducing ſpirits,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 1. and <hi>a ſpirit of errour,</hi> 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
               <p>Now for a man to ſay, or boaſt, that he hath the <hi>ſpirit of truth,</hi> or the <hi>ſpirit of God,</hi> is no ſufficient argument to prove that he hath the <hi>ſpirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thou haſt tried them, which ſay they are Apoſtles, and are not, and haſt found them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars:</hi> ſaith the <hi>Spirit</hi> to the Angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Rev. 2. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And I know the blaſphemy of them that ſay they are Jews, and are not, but are the ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of Satan:</hi> ſaith the ſame <hi>Spirit,</hi> Rev. 2. 9 An outward verball oſtentation, is no infallible ſigne of an inward reall <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> And therefore that of St. <hi>John</hi> is very ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for theſe times of uncertainty: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>beleeve not every ſpirit; but</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:123675:93"/> 
                  <hi>try the ſpirits whether they be of God:</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 1. But you will ſay, How ſhall we be able to do that?</p>
               <p>Why, the ſame Apoſtle proceedeth in the next verſe to give us one ſingular good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: <hi>Hereby know we the ſpirit of God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>every ſpirit that confeſſeth that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh, is of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be objected further, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one who pretendeth to the name of a Chriſtian, will eaſily confeſſe that <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> is come in the fleſh: and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, every one that pretendeth to the name of a Chriſtian, is of <hi>God,</hi> and hath the <hi>ſpirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this generall aſſertion will not ſerve the turn: without doubt the holy <hi>Ghoſt</hi> hath theſe further intentions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that this confeſſion muſt proceed from an effectual faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For unleſſe the heart beleeveth unto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, the mouth cannot confeſſe unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath put them both together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, this confeſſion muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the whole myſtery of <hi>Chriſts</hi> incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. As the Divinity of his generation, the purity of his conception, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection both of his divine and humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:123675:94"/> together with his doctrine and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, his ſufferings and ſatisfaction, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and aſcenſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And every ſpirit that confeſſeth not, that Jeſus Chriſt is come in the fleſh</hi> (according to all theſe truths) <hi>is not of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 3.</p>
               <p>If you will proceed to a further triall of the ſpirits, obſerve their fruit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The fruit of the ſpirit of God is love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gentleneſſe, goodneſſe, faith, meekneſſe, temperance:</hi> Gal. 5. 22. <hi>And they that live in the ſpirit, do alſo walk in the ſpirit, not deſirous of vain-glory, provoking one another, envying one another,</hi> Galat. 5. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>And whomſoever we do really find walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contrary to theſe, or any of theſe, we may ſay with St. <hi>Jude: Though they ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelves, they are ſenſuall, having not the ſpirit:</hi> Jude 19.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall a man behave himſelf, if he ſhall happen to be beſet, or tempted by theſe, or the like evil ſeducing ſpirits?</p>
               <p>Why, <hi>I beſeech you brethren, mark them which cauſe diviſions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned, and avoid them:</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 16. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If any man conſent not to wholeſome words: even the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and</hi>

                  <hi>to the doctrine which is according to godlineſſe: he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about queſtions and ſtrifes of words, whereof cometh envie, ſtrife, railings, evil ſurmiſings, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe diſputings of men of corrupt minds, and deſtitute of the truth, ſuppoſing that gain is godlineſſe; from ſuch withdraw thy ſelf.</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They that have the form of godlineſſe</hi> (in profeſſion) <hi>and deny the power thereof</hi> (in practice) <hi>from ſuch turn away:</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Their mouths muſt be ſtopped, who ſubvert whole houſes, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucres ſake:</hi> ſaith the ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 11.</p>

               <p>We muſt not look upon the word of <hi>God,</hi> as a thing indifferent; but we muſt deſire it, as babes deſire milk, their beſt-pleaſing, and moſt proper food and nouriſhment. <hi>I eſteemed thy word more then my neceſſary food,</hi> ſaith holy <hi>Job,</hi> Job 23. 12. <hi>And thy word was unto me the joy, and the rejoycing of my heart;</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> to the <hi>Lord God of hoſts:</hi> Jer. 15. 16.</p>
               <p>If theſe be things to be neglected, then may we alſo neglect the good word of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, we are ſenſible that the hearing of the word of <hi>God</hi> is very much damnified by the means of negligence.</p>
               <p>And this negligence may be ſaid to be three-fold.</p>
               <p>Firſt, there is a negligence in coming to hear the word of <hi>God.</hi> There are many men and women that think, if they come to hear, onely when their lazineſſe, or leiſure will give them leave; once, or twice in a
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:123675:95"/> moneth, or haply in a quarter, is very fair. <hi>But to day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 3. 7, 8. He that will not hear the voice of <hi>God</hi> from the mouth of his Miniſters, to day, this day, every day, when it may be heard with any convenience: It is a ſore ſigne that his heart is either hardned, or upon hardning. A fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full judgement. And therefore the ſame Apoſtle in the ſame Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take heed, brethren, leaſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God: But exhort one another daily while it is called to day, leaſt any of you be hardned through the deceitfulneſſe of ſin,</hi> Hebr. 3. 12, 13.</p>
               <p>Secondly, there is a negligence in hearing. If the Devil cannot hinder a man from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in at the Church door, then common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he endeavoureth to block up the door of his heart, that the word may finde no profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table entrance. And to further him in this his deſign, either he diſordereth the ſenſes, and diſpoſeth them to ſlumbring, prating; gazing, or the like ungodly ingagements, or elſe he breedeth ſuch a mutiny in the affections, that they will by no means agree to give the word of <hi>God</hi> the leaſt cordial en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment: As if the <hi>Lord</hi> had ſent the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:123675:96"/> ſame deſperate curſe among theſe negligent hearers, which he ſometime ſent by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet unto the Rebellions <hi>Iſraelites. Go, and tell this people: hear ye indeed, but underſtand not, and ſee ye indeed, but perceive not: make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes: leaſt they ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and underſtand with their heart: and convert, and be healed,</hi> Iſa. 6. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, there is a negligence after hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that appeareth in not practiſing the word, when, and after it is heard.</p>
               <p>And I conceive that the parable of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> concerning the Sower may (not impertinently) be applied to this purpoſe. I pray obſerve his own expoſition, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. beginning <hi>verſe</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſeed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the word of God. Thoſe by the wayes ſide, are they that hear, then cometh the Devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, leaſt they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and be ſaved.</hi> Here is the malice of the Devil.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They on the Rock, are they, which when they hear, receive the word with joy, and theſe have no root; which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</hi> There is the infirmity of the fleſh. <hi>And that which fell</hi>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:123675:96"/> 
                  <hi>among Thorns, are they, which when they have heard, go forth, and are choaked with cares and riches, and pleaſures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</hi> Here are the cares and ſnares of the world.</p>
               <p>Theſe were all hearers, but never a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſer. The malice of the Devil, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of the fleſh: together with the cares and ſnares of the world, will not leave them ſo much as one word (as we ſay) to bleſſe themſelves withall.</p>
               <p>And truely much of this through negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: When was it that the enemy came, and ſowed Tares among the Wheat? <hi>but while men ſlept,</hi> Mat. 13. 25. While they were negligent, and careleſſe. <hi>Be ſober therefore, be vigilant</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Peter) becauſe your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary the Devil, as a roaring Lion walketh about, ſeeking whom he may devoure,</hi> 1 Peter 5. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And be ye doers of the Word, and not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers onely, deceiving your own ſelves,</hi> James 1. 22.</p>
               <p>Secondly, take heed how ye hear deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. <hi>Thou ſon of man</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Lord</hi> to his Prophet <hi>Ezekiel) the Children of thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtill are talking againſt thee by the walls, and in the doors of the houſes, and ſpeak one to another, every one to his brother: ſaying, come,</hi>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:123675:97"/> 
                  <hi>I pray you, and hear what is the Word, that cometh forth from the Lord. And they come unto thee, as the people cometh, and they ſit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee as my people; and they hear thy words: but they will not do them, for with their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetouſneſſe,</hi> Ezek. 33. 30, 31.</p>
               <p>See how theſe Hypocrites do vilifie the Prophet of the <hi>Lord</hi> in private. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, they ſeem to be very zealous for the word of the <hi>Lord</hi> in publick: and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they come unto the Prophet, and they ſit before him as <hi>Gods</hi> own people, and they do hear his words. But here is the deceit, they will not do them: for they are Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical and ſelf-ended: <hi>with their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetouſneſſe.</hi> And may there not be deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hearers in theſe our dayes? that follow the word meerly, that they may be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good Chriſtians? or becauſe they think this to be the onely prevailing way, both to make them capable of all manner of imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though they be never ſo unfit, and undeſerving: And likewiſe to countenance all their proceedings, though never ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and unconſcionable?</p>
               <p>And therefore (if you obſerve it) they will ſeldom, or never hear the word: though
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:123675:97"/> never ſo ſincerely, plainly, and powerfully delivered: but when they think it may conduce to their carnal profit, or prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The cry of their heart is: <hi>who will ſhew us any good,</hi> not <hi>Lord lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us,</hi> as <hi>Pſalm</hi> 4. 6. Is not this to hear the word of God deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully?</p>
               <p>Is it not a work of the <hi>Lord,</hi> to hear the word of the <hi>Lord?</hi> Truely it is ſuch a work, as doth very well manifeſt, who is our Maſter. <hi>He that is of God, heareth Gods words: Ye therefore hear them not, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ecauſe ye are not of God,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Son of God,</hi> to the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Jews,</hi> John 8. 47.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And curſed is he, that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 48. 10.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, take heed how you hear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpightfully: <hi>Whoſo deſpiſeth the word, ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon,</hi> Prov. 13. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that deſpiſeth you, deſpiſeth me; and he that deſpiſeth me: deſpiſeth him that ſent me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> to his ſeventy Diſciples, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He therefore that deſpiſeth, deſpiſeth not Man, but God,</hi> ſaith that Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſſa.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:123675:98"/>
               <p> But you will ſay, that there is no man ſo ungracious, as to deſpiſe the word of <hi>God</hi> in the mouth of his Miniſters. No? What think you then of thoſe factions, frantick ſpirits, that wry the mouth at every Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which agreeth not with their own erronious, or peradventure blaſphemous opinions? Or what do you think of thoſe foul ſtomacks, that will by no means diſgeſt the ſincere milk of the word, but will rather ſpet it out in reproches, unleſſe it be ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with faithleſſe revelations, flattering Propheſies, fair promiſes, falſe invectives, freſh intelligence, or the like frivolous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies, which taſte like Sugar to their corrupted appetites? Or what do you think of thoſe prepoſterous hearers, that come to <hi>Gods</hi> Ordinances? Not with <hi>Davids</hi> reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: <hi>To hear what God the Lord will ſpeak,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85. 8.</p>
               <p>But with an <hi>Athenian</hi> prejudice: <hi>What will this babler ſay,</hi> as <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 18.</p>
               <p>Neither ſhall the <hi>Son of God</hi> eſcape bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then his ſervants. <hi>For ſome ſaid he is a good man: others ſaid, Nay, but he deceiveth the people,</hi> John 7. 11.</p>
               <p>Whereas in truth they deceived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Is not this to deſpiſe both <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Goſpel? <hi>He that deſpiſed</hi> Moſes <hi>law</hi>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:123675:98"/> 
                  <hi>died without mercy, under two, or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. Of how much ſorer puniſhment, ſuppoſe ye ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den under foot the Son of God, and hath coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the bloud of the Covenant, wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpight unto the ſpirit of grace,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Hebr. 10. 28, 29.</p>
               <p>Wherefore let the <hi>Preacher</hi> perſwade you to <hi>keep your feet, when you go into the houſe of God: and be more ready to hear, then to give the ſacrifice of fools,</hi> Eccl. 5. 1.</p>
               <p>That is, keep, or ſee to your affections, which carry about the Soul, as the feet do carry about the body: and be more ready to hear, then to give the ſacrifice of fools: what ſacrifice is that? why you know that under the Law, they did uſe to offer beaſts in ſacrifice.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And theſe, as natural brute beaſts made to be taken and deſtroyed (do offer themſelves) to ſpeak evil of the things, that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not, and ſhall utterly periſh in their own corruption,</hi> according to that of <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 12.</p>
               <p>But take heed, that ye do hear the word of <hi>God</hi> attentively, reverently, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently.</p>
               <p>Firſt, take heed, that ye hear attentively.
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:123675:99"/> We finde that the <hi>Lord</hi> commended <hi>Mary,</hi> for attending to his Sermon: when her ſiſter <hi>Martha</hi> accuſed her for neglecting his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 39. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Attention is the <hi>Lords</hi> own work: for it was the <hi>Lord</hi> that opened the heart of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> that ſhe attended unto the things, which were ſpoken of <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 16. 14.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf will reward it. <hi>We are all here preſent before God, to hear all things, that are commanded thee of God,</hi> ſaith that good <hi>Centurion to</hi> St. Peter, Acts 10. 33.</p>
               <p>Here was a Teſtimony of their attention. <hi>And the holy Ghoſt fell on all them that heard the word,</hi> verſe 44.</p>
               <p>There was the reward of their attention. They received the gift of the holy <hi>Ghoſt.</hi> A gift ſo precious, that it is impoſſible for any to value it, but onely ſuch as have true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, take heed that ye do hear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently. <hi>Receive with meekneſſe the ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed word, which is able to ſave your ſouls,</hi> Ja. 1. 21.</p>
               <p>And <hi>for this cauſe thank we God without ceaſing</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) becauſe when ye received the word of God, which ye heard of us, ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it, not as the word of men, but (as it is in truth) the word of God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 13.</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:123675:99"/>
               <p> Contrary to theſe are they (who proud of their own parts) do creep into the ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> to put the whole flock into a confuſion: endeavouring (not to obtain grace from <hi>Chriſt)</hi> but to diſgrace the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, where they cannot take occaſions of offence, they will be ſure to make occaſions of offence: Neither can the moſt weighty, and well-grounded arguments ſuffice to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence their illiterate impudence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They have ſaid, with our tongue will we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, our lips are our own, who is Lord over us,</hi> according to that of the Prophet, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 12. 4.</p>
               <p>But contrary to that of the Apoſtle: <hi>My brethren, be not many Maſters,</hi> Ja. 1. 3.</p>
               <p>Theſe trouble-truths (in ſpight of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning) are gifted men: Yet it is probable, that they take unto themſelves, more then what is given them. <hi>I have not ſent theſe Prophets: yet they ran, I have not ſpoken unto them, yet they propheſied,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord,</hi> Jer. 23. 21. They ſay not with our <hi>Saviour: who hath ears to hear, let him hear, Mat.</hi> 13. 9. But like themſelves, who hath a tongue to ſpeak, let him ſpeak. Yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will they allow any thing to be well ſpoken: but what they ſpeak by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:123675:100"/> or by their Diſciples, who do onely ſpeak themſelves.</p>
               <p>Theſe are they, that ſay, they have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the pattent of the ſpirit wholy to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their aſſigns: and that they have the onely true light in their own dark Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorns.</p>
               <p>But we may chooſe to believe them: For we muſt believe <hi>God,</hi> rather then men.</p>
               <p>And our <hi>God</hi> ſendeth us: <hi>To the Law, and to the Teſtimony,</hi> and telleth us: that, <hi>if they ſpeak not according to this word, it is, becauſe there is no light in them,</hi> Iſa. 8. 20.</p>
               <p>And therefore, ſo long as they reject this word, their pretended light is like to doe them but little good. But judge of them, ſay they, we may not: For they are all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he that is ſpiritual, judgeth all things, yet he himſelf is judged of none.</hi> According to that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
               <p>Truely, we need not: The <hi>Spirit of God</hi> hath long ſince judged them, and pointed them out, as <hi>men before of old ordained unto this condemnation:</hi> And that both by the <hi>Son of God</hi> himſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe by divers of his Apoſtles: By <hi>Paul</hi> 2. to <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. to the 10th. By <hi>Peter,</hi> 2. Pet. 2. By <hi>Jude,</hi> Jude 4. to the 20th.</p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:123675:100"/>
               <p> In many other places they are lively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, but in theſe ſo exactly diſcovered, both for time and manners, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hide themſelves from any: ſave onely from thoſe ſilly Souls, whom they themſelves have moſt miſerably blinded and bewitch'd: whoſe lamentable condition is much to be pitied.</p>
               <p>Now as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> withſtood <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo do theſe alſo reſiſt the truth: <hi>Men of corrupt mindes, reprobate concerning the Faith: But they ſhall proceed no further. For their folly ſhall be manifeſt unto all men, as theirs alſo was.</hi> This is our <hi>Lords</hi> promiſe under the hand of one of his principal Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 8, 9.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, take heed that ye do hear obediently. <hi>Behold, to obey, is better then ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and to hearken, then the fat of Rams,</hi> ſaith <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. 22.</p>

                     </gap>k when your fear cometh,</hi> &amp;c. Pro. 1. 24. &amp;c. <hi>But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever cometh to me, &amp; heareth my ſayings, and doth them: I will ſhew you to whom he is like, he is like a man which built an houſe, and digged deep, and laid the foundation on a Rock: and when the flood aroſe the ſtream beat vehemently upon that houſe, &amp; could not ſhake it: for it was founded upon a Rock,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that Rock and foundation of our faith, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 47, 48.</p>
               <p>Truely, whoſoever ſhall take heed what he heareth: And how he heareth, according to the preceding particulars. I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that he ſhall neither be barren, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull in the knowledge of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thus have I indeavoured to ſhew you: both, that faith is obtained by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: And likewiſe what, and how you ſhall hear: ſo, as that you may obtain faith.</p>
               <p>But there is yet a queſtion, which may be demanded in this caſe: And it will be this. May not faith be obtained by reading? I anſwer, that I doubt not, but it may.</p>
               <p>For as in hearing we receive the word of <hi>God</hi> by the ear: ſo in reading we receive the word of <hi>God</hi> by the eye. Now the word of <hi>God</hi> is that incorruptible ſeed whereby
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:123675:101"/> we are regenerate &amp; born again, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. And it is not material how we do receive this ſeed; provided, that we do receive it into honeſt hearts, and keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience, as <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 15.</p>
               <p>For by this means faith is both produced and improved. Nevertheleſſe, it is a very rare thing to get faith by reading: And therefore reading is not to be compared to hearing in this particular.</p>
               <p>For firſt, the word of <hi>God</hi> is full of deep myſteries, very hard to be underſtood with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much induſtry, even by the ſtrongeſt apprehenſion. <hi>Without controverſie, great is the myſtery of godlineſſe:</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16.</p>
               <p>Is it an eaſie matter to conceive rightly of the <hi>Godhead,</hi> eſſentially and perſonally?</p>
               <p>Or of the two <hi>Covenants,</hi> the one of <hi>Works,</hi> and the other of <hi>Grace.</hi> And that the laſt ſhould be firſt, according to <hi>Gods</hi> contract and ordination; though laſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mans uſe and expectation?</p>
               <p>Is it an eaſie thing for a man to ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the promiſe to <hi>Adam,</hi> and the fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the floud? Or in the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> revealed unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the ſeal of Circumciſion to himſelf and his beleeving poſterity, till their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:123675:102"/> out of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> bondage? Or afterwards in the ceremoniall Law, wherein he was exhibited, or holden forth more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly, though yet obſcurely in types and ſhadows, until his coming in the fleſh? Is it an eaſie thing for a man rightly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>Gods</hi> Evangelical purpoſes, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the moral Law (that exact copy of the covenant of works?) And his ſeveral ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents &amp; limitations intended in his Goſpel?</p>
               <p>Truly, if theſe and the like difficulties do not require an exact induſtry, &amp; a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary judgement: I have no judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all. And therefore, <hi>Lean not to thine own underſtanding:</hi> ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſſe, it is this kind of ſelf-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that hath thus obſcured the light of the Goſpel with ſo many anti-chriſtian er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. <hi>A wiſe man will hear, and will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe learning:</hi> ſaith <hi>Salomon, Prov.</hi> 1. 5.</p>
               <p>As the <hi>Aethiopian Eunuch</hi> was riding in his charet, and reading the Prophet <hi>Eſaias: Philip</hi> ran thither unto him, and ſaid, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeſt thou what thou readeſt?</hi> And he ſaid, <hi>How can I, except ſome man ſhould guide me?</hi> Acts 8. 28.</p>
               <p>Verily, he hath need of a good guide, that ſhall dive for faith in this deep my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:123675:102"/> 
                  <hi>Even the myſtery which hath been hid from ages, and from generations; but now is made manifeſt unto the Saints of God:</hi> Col. 1. 26.</p>
               <p>But you may ſay, Do we not ſee, that in theſe dayes many ignorant and unlearned perſons: even they that cannot, or can but very hardly read: do nevertheleſſe take upon them to teach the word of <hi>God</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, and with much confidence, whileſt men of great learning, and ſuch as have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved their knowledge, and judgement by a long continued exerciſe, and induſtry, are ſlighed, and neglected.</p>
               <p>This indeed we find to be true by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable experience, neither hath the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell a more deſtructive engine to batter and beat down the truth: or to bring the Goſpel into contempt, and unto confuſion. For doth not the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſay?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That in his brother</hi> Pauls <hi>Epiſtles there are ſome things hard to he underſtood, which they that are unlearned and unſtable, wreſt, as they do alſo the other Scriptures, unto their own deſtruction;</hi> with this caveat: <hi>Ye therefore, he loved, ſeeing ye know theſe things before, beware leaſt ye alſo being led away with the errour of the wicked, fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 3, 16, 17.</p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:123675:103"/>
               <p> But they Object, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did advertiſe his Apoſtles, ſaying: <hi>Take no thought how or what ye ſhall ſpeak, for it ſhall be given you in that ſame hour, what ye ſhall ſpeak,</hi> Mat. 10. 19.</p>
               <p>True: But this was in caſe of their own defence: where the <hi>Saviour</hi> charged his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles not to be carefull to provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of any cunning or artificiall excuſe: but to commit themſelves confidently to the <hi>Lord,</hi> for their protection and aſſiſtance: who will undoubtedly ſtand with them, and ſtrengthen them in all ſuch trialls. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did afterwards finde by experience, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 17.</p>
               <p>But in other caſes, and places, eſpecially in the houſe of <hi>God. Be not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be haſtie to utter any thing before God.</hi> Saith that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Preacher. <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 5. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>And amongſt <hi>Pauls</hi> admonitions to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothie: Study</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to ſhew thy ſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved unto God, a workman that needeth not be aſhamed: rightly dividing the word of truth,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 15.</p>
               <p>But were not the Apoſtles ignorant and unlearned men?</p>
               <p>They were ſo: And it was very much agreeable to <hi>Gods</hi> wiſdom, to chooſe ſuch,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:123675:103"/> as were neither cunning Stateſmen: nor elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Oratours: leaſt his Goſpel ſhould be ſuſpected, to have been invented by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, or maintained by ſophiſtry.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My ſpeech and my preaching was not with enticing words of mans wiſdom, but in ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of the ſpirit, and of power. That your Faith ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God:</hi> Saith that learned Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>But thoſe ignorant men had an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable <hi>maſter:</hi> who could as well inable, as command them to ſpeak or do, whatſoever was expedient or neceſſary to the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and confirmation of his Truth and Goſpel, which appeared moſt manifeſtly in that he perſonally impowered them to work miracles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 1. And ſoon after his aſcention inriched them with the gift of the holy <hi>Ghoſt</hi> in a viſible manner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>They began immediately to ſpeak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterances, Acts</hi> 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>And whoſoever can make it appear, that he is truely qualified with theſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary indowments: I ſhall eaſily allow him that title of an Apoſtle: which many novices do now uſurpe merely by vertue of their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. Or otherwiſe, I need not fear to
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:123675:104"/> ſay unto them as our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſome time ſaid unto the Sadduces.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ye erre becauſe ye know not the Scriptures nor the power of God,</hi> Mat. 22. 29.</p>
               <p>Secondly in obtaining faith reading is not comparable to hearing: for though a man hath never ſuch an excellent appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion: yet the nature of man is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally proud, and partiall to his own incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations. Inſomuch, that when he meeteth with any exhortation, or reproof, that croſſeth, or contradicteth his beloved cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, he is eaſily inclined to paſs it by: as a thing little materiall to his purpoſe, he will not readily faſten it upon himſelf And by this means he ſeldom or never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainteth himſelf with the doctrine of <hi>ſelf-deniall,</hi> whereas our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith <hi>whoſoever will come after me, let him deny himſelf.</hi> Mar. 8. 34. And truely till a man feeleth himſelf ſinking under the weight of his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and utterly loſt in all his other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations: he will hardly lay hold upon the <hi>Son of God</hi> to ſave him.</p>
               <p>And whoſoevet doth not lay hold upon him by the hand of a ſaving faith, he muſt periſh eternally. <hi>He that beleeveth on the Son hath everlaſting life: and he that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life: but the</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:123675:104"/> 
                  <hi>wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> John 3. 36.</p>
               <p>But ſhall a man come to the knowledge of his own corruptions rather by hearing then by reading?</p>
               <p>I anſwer that it is the more promiſing way by much: for whereas a man may fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour himſelf in reading: yet the word of <hi>God</hi> in the mouth of his miniſter, is, or ought to be powerfull and impartiall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For if I yet pleaſed men, I ſhould not be the ſervant of</hi> Chriſt ſaith <hi>Paul. Gal.</hi> 1. 10.</p>
               <p>And to this purpoſe it was, that the ſame Apoſtle did give that forcible charge to his beloved <hi>Timothie. I charge thee therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> God <hi>(ſaith he) and the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rd</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who ſhall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing, and his kingdom: Preach the word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon, reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-ſuffering, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>And I doubt not but I may ſay, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, as the Apoſtle ſaid of Chaſtening. <hi>No reproof, for the preſent, ſeemeth to be joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but grievous: nevertheleſs, afterward it yeeldeth the peaceable fruit of righteouſneſſe unto them, that are exerciſed thereby,</hi> Heb. 12. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But he that being often reproved, hardeneth his neck, ſhall ſuddainly be deſtroyed, and that</hi>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:123675:105"/> 
                  <hi>without remedie,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Pro.</hi> 29. 1.</p>
               <p>Thirdly reading is not ſo neceſſary as hearing: Becauſe we find no ſuch precept, or command for the one, as for the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The prieſts lips ſhould keep knowledge: and they ſhould ſeek the Law at his mouth: for he is the meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts. Malac.</hi> 2. 7. And if the church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> were to ſeek the Law, at the mouth of the ſacrificing Prieſt: How much rather are we to ſeek the <hi>Goſpel</hi> at the mouth of the miniſter of <hi>Chriſt? For if the miniſtration of condemnation be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: much more doth the miniſtration of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe exceed in glory.</hi> Saith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore my beloved brethren, let every man be quick to hear, ſlow to ſpeak. Saith James.</hi> Ja. 1. 19.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> crieth out ſeaven times in the ſecond and third Chapters of the <hi>Revelation. He that hath an ear let him hear, what the Spirit ſaith unto the Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, we find no ſuch promiſe made to reading, as is made to hearing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your ſoul ſhall live: And I will make an everlaſting covenant with you even the ſure mercies of David:</hi> ſaith the Lord by his Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 3. And thus his onely <hi>Son:</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:123675:105"/> 
                  <hi>verily, verily, I ſay unto you: he that heareth my word, and beleeveth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting life: and ſhall not come into condemnation, but is paſſed from death to life,</hi> John 5. 24.</p>
               <p>And fiftly, we have no preſident, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of any that beleeved by reading: But we find that many thouſands beleeved by hearing, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 41. and 4, 4. and 13. 48. and 17. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching to ſave them that beleeve,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 21.</p>
               <p>And you know, that preaching hath its relation to hearing, and not to reading.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay: to what purpoſe then do we bring up our children to reading? or what do we with our Bibles, and other godly books? if reading in them be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, as you ſay it is?</p>
               <p>Good <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> I pray miſtake me not, I do not ſay it is unneceſſary: But I ſay, it is not ſo neceſſary or commodious for the getting of faith, as hearing is.</p>
               <p>The word which we read in the book, is not ſo powerfull; ſo full of ſpirit and life, as that which we hear from <hi>God,</hi> by the mouth of his miniſters. <hi>The words that I ſpeak unto you, they are ſpirit, and they are life, ſaith our Lord</hi> Chriſt, Joh. 6. 63.</p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:123675:106"/>
               <p> Nevertheleſs I am ſo farr from condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reading (although it may be much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, as the beſt things too often are) That I commend it for a beneficiall, and a bleſſed excerciſe to all ſorts of people, both unbeleevers, and beleevers. For in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to unbeleevers. Firſt it prepareth them for hearing; by acquainting them with the hiſtory, and making them familiar with the body of the Scriptures. And you know that a man will more freely and willingly receive and entertain that, which is familiar unto him, then that, which is ſtrang, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known: unleſs he be of ſuch an Athenian, or Atheiſticall ſpirit, as to ſpend his time in nothing elſe: but <hi>either to tell, or to hear ſome new thing as</hi> Acts 17. 21.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it inableth them to hear with the greater diſcretion: and the more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, to find out the ſeverall places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cited by the Miniſter, either at the preſent, or at their better leiſure.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> to whom <hi>Paul</hi> preached at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea</hi> were commended for the more noble: In that they received the word with readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, <hi>and ſearched the Scriptures daily whether thoſe things were ſo.</hi> Acts 17. 11. <hi>Therefore many of them beleeved.</hi> verſ. 12. And as for the true beleevers (who are
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:123675:106"/> neither wedded to their own underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor captivated by their own corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>For the Spirit of</hi> God <hi>is with them. And where the Spirit of</hi> God <hi>is, there is liberty.</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 17.</p>
               <p>To them, I ſay, reading is yet more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and proper: For it ſerveth to aſſiſt their memories, to improve their medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and likewiſe to ſtrengthen, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their Faith.</p>
               <p>And queſtionleſs it was principally for theſe ends, and purpoſes: that the Apoſtles did write their Epiſtles to be read in divers churches or congregations, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the Saints of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Such are, were in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> by faith: whereunto they had been formerly convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by hearing the Goſpell preached unto them, either by the Authours of the ſame Epiſtles, or by ſome other of the Apoſtles or Evangeliſts.</p>
               <p>And therefore I ſay unto all men, women, and children concerning reading, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: as <hi>Paul</hi> ſome time ſaid to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> concerning ſpirituall gifts, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Deſire reading, but rather that ye may hear. For faith cometh by hearing: and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (cometh) <hi>by the word of</hi> God (preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:123675:107"/> 
                  <hi>How can they hear without a preacher,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14.</p>
               <p>Now the reaſon why I have thus taken upon me to anſwer this queſtion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reading is this.</p>
               <p>Becauſe many think to excuſe themſelves very well from attending upon <hi>God</hi> in his publick Ordinances: by pretending that they do benefit themſelves as much by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good books at home.</p>
               <p>But truely they do very mightily deceive themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that knoweth</hi> God, <hi>heareth us: he that is not of</hi> God, <hi>heareth not us: hereby know we the Spirit of truth, and the Spirit of errour. Saith</hi> that loving and beloved Diſciple, <hi>John</hi> 4. 6.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>WE are now come to anſwer the fift and laſt Queſtion, compleatly perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to the examination of this <hi>Beleevers evidence:</hi> which is this. How ſhall a man know whether he hath this ſaving faith, or not? That we may poſſeſs our ſelves of a right underſtanding, in a matter of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: let us exactly conſider that place of the Prophet <hi>Jeremy.</hi> Where he compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth or likeneth a faithfull perſon to a
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:123675:107"/> goodly Tree, that is richly planted, well rooted, full of ſap, flouriſhing, fair, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
               <p>You ſhall finde in the ſeventeenth of the Propheſie of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> at the ſeventh and eighth verſes. In theſe words: <hi>Bleſſed is the man that truſteth in the Lord, and whoſe hope the Lord is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For he ſhall be as a Tree planted by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that ſpreadeth out her roots by the River, and ſhall not ſee when heat cometh: but her leaf ſhall be green, and ſhall not be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the year of drought: neither ſhall ceaſe from yielding fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, this Tree is richly planted: For ſhe is planted by the waters. And <hi>Job</hi> telleth us: <hi>That though a Tree be cut down, and that the root thereof wax old in the earth: yet through the ſent of water, it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant,</hi> Job 14. 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſhe is well rooted: for ſhe ſpreadeth out her roots by the River, ſhe ſpreadeth out her roots, and that by the River.</p>
               <p>Not by filthy, myery, or muddy waters: but by the pure and pleaſant ſtreams.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Lord</hi> had planted a Garden in <hi>Eden,</hi> with every Tree, that was pleaſant to the ſight, and good for food. <hi>He provided</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:123675:108"/> 
                  <hi>a River to water the Garden,</hi> Geneſ. 2. 10.</p>
               <p>And it was the firſt commendation of the land of Promiſe: <hi>That it was a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains, and depths, that ſpring out of vallies and hills,</hi> Deut. 8. 7.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſhe is full of ſap: <hi>The Trees of the Lord are full of ſap,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. 16.</p>
               <p>And how can ſhe be otherwiſe, ſeeing ſhe is ſo richly planted, and ſo well rooted: And therefore ſhe ſhall not ſee, or be ſenſible when the parching heat paſſeth over her.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, this Tree is flouriſhing, for her leaf ſhall be green. <hi>Her leaf ſhall not wither,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>David</hi> upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 3.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, ſhe is freſh and fair, and ſo ſhe ſhall continue: <hi>For ſhe ſhall not be carefull in the year of drougth,</hi> ſhe ſhall put forth beautifull buds, and bloſſomes never the leſſe.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, and laſtly, ſhe is fruitfull, very fruitfull. <hi>For ſhe ſhall not ceaſe from yielding fruits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But you will ſay, what reſemblance, or likeneſſe is there between this flouriſhing Tree, and a true believer?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, let this be alwayes conſidered,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:123675:108"/> that thoſe things, which are ſpoken of this fruitfull Tree are natural: and thoſe things that are to be ſpoken of the faithfull man are ſpiritual, and then we ſhall finde, that they agree in all theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>For, as this natural Tree is richly plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, well rooted, full of Sap, flouriſhing, fair, and fruitfull. So the ſpiritual man is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe richly planted, well rooted, full of ſap, flouriſhing, fair, and fruitfull. The ground wherein he is planted is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> His root is <hi>faith,</hi> his ſap is <hi>love,</hi> his green leaves are <hi>gracious profeſſions,</hi> his fair and beautifull bloſſoms are <hi>bleſſed and holy deſires,</hi> and his good fruits are <hi>godly performances, or good works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whoſoever ſhall thus reſemble this flouriſhing Tree, according to theſe ſix pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties: I dare avouch him for a true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever.</p>
               <p>And therefore we will now begin to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, whether we be in the faith, according unto theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, we muſt be richly planted: That is, we muſt be planted into <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We finde that they, which are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the benefits, and bleſſings <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt, are called Trees of righteouſneſſe, the planting of the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 61. 3.</p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:123675:109"/>
               <p> Verily, we are all originally wilde ſlips, every man and woman muſt ſay with <hi>David: Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me,</hi> Pſal. 51. 5.</p>
               <p>This is a very bad ground to thrive upon. This is all the comfort, that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, or may expect to receive from our earthly old man: <hi>For in</hi> Adam <hi>all die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore it is neceſſary that we be removed, and planted into the heavenly new man. <hi>For as in</hi> Adam <hi>all die: even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive, as in</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 22.</p>
               <p>Hereby we ſhall injoy a double benefit. Namely, the benefit of <hi>Chriſts</hi> death: and the benefit of his reſurrection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For if we have been planted together in the likeneſſe of his death: we ſhall be alſo in the likeneſſe of his reſurrection,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 5.</p>
               <p>Where he teacheth us: that whoſoever is planted into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> according to the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his death: he ſhall be alſo planted into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> according to the likeneſſe of his reſurrection.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For in that he died, he died unto ſin: but in that he liveth he liveth unto God. Likewiſe rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon ye alſo your ſelves to be dead indeed unto ſin: but alive unto God, through Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:123675:109"/> 
                  <hi>our Lord,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle in the ſame Chapt. at the 10. and 11. verſes.</p>
               <p>But it may be demanded, how a man may be ſaid to be dead indeed unto ſin? ſeeing that ſo long as a man liveth in the fleſh, he ſhall never be altogether free, from the luſts of the fleſh: the ſnares of the world, and the aſſaults of Satan, which will continually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke unto ſin, and ſometimes prevail, even in the moſt ſanctified Soul: the beſt diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the moſt retired Chriſtian under heaven?</p>
               <p>Inſomuch that <hi>Paul</hi> cries out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The good that I would, I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do,</hi> Rom. 7. 19.</p>
               <p>And in the 23. <hi>verſe</hi> of the ſame Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſee another Law in my Members, warring againſt the Law of my minde, and bringing me into captivity to the Law of ſin, which is in my Members.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In many things we offend all,</hi> James 3. 2. And likewiſe <hi>John</hi> the beloved. <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us,</hi> 1 John 1. 8.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, that I underſtand theſe words: <hi>dead indeed,</hi> for very near dead, or even as good as dead: And not for totally, or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely dead. For ſo, I conceive, a man ſhall never be dead, indeed, unto ſin: <hi>untill this</hi>

Death is ſwallowed up in victory,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 54. And therefore how the Perfectionaries dare to give <hi>God</hi> the lie, and their own conſciences the blinde baffle, is a thing beyond mine apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, as there are certain ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, or ſignes, or accidents, by which we may be able to judge, when a man is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a dead man (as we ſay) or at leaſt ſo far ſpent, that there is no hope of his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: and that before his Soul hath utterly forſaken his body. So if we ſhall conſider the ſame ſymptomes, or ſignes, after a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual manner: we ſhall be able thereby to conjecture, when a man may be ſaid to be dead indeed unto ſin, before he is wholy freed from the corruption of nature.</p>
               <p>There are many ſigns, that may confirm our judgements in this particular. I ſhall inſtance onely four: Namely, loſſe of appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, loſſe of ſpeech, loſſe of memory, and loſſe of motion.</p>
               <p>The firſt is loſſe of appetite, and that is when ſin begins to be odious, or loathſome. <hi>The Soul of the wicked deſireth evil,</hi> ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 10.</p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:123675:110"/>
               <p> But when a man beginneth to die unto ſin: that which before was his deſire, is now become his diſeaſe: he loaths that moſt, which formerly he moſt longed after.</p>
               <p>We read that <hi>David being in a hold: and a garriſon of the Philiſtines in</hi> Bethlehem: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid longed, and ſaid: Oh, that one would give me to drink of the water of the Well of</hi> Bethlehem, <hi>which is by the Gate. And three mighty men brake through the Hoſt of the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines, and drew water out of the Well of</hi> Bethlehem, <hi>that was by the Gate, and took it and brought it to</hi> David: <hi>Nevertheleſſe, he would not drink thereof, but poured it out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord,</hi> or before the <hi>Lord: And he ſaid: be it far from me, O Lord, that I ſhould doe this: Is not this the bloud of the men, that went in Jeopardy of their lives? Therefore he would not drink it,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. 14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>This was much in a King to deny himſelf in that, which even now he ſo vehemently deſired. But little, or nothing in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of that repugnancy, or oppoſition, that is uſually found to be in the Saints of God. For whereas, before their effectual calling and converſion, their carnal deſires may peradventure be ſo preſſing, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate upon them: that they can devour wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows houſes, drink iniquity like water, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:123675:111"/> work all uncleanneſſe with greedineſſe. Yet when (through the grace of <hi>God)</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be ſenſibly ſick of ſin: their appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites are ſo ſtrangely altered, that they do not onely diſlike and diſtaſte every thing that is unlawfull: but likewiſe they do ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly abhorre it, as it is odious, or diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in the ſight of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They abſtain from all appearance of evil,</hi> according to that precept of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 22.</p>
               <p>This is one ſign, whereby we may diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, when a man may be ſaid to be dead un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin. Another is loſſe of ſpeech.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The tongue</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>is an unruly evil, full of deadly poiſon,</hi> James 3. 8.</p>
               <p>And <hi>David</hi> deſcribing a wicked perſon; ſaith, <hi>That he oaſteth of his hearts deſire and bleſſeth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth,</hi> Pſal. 10. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet his mouth is full of curſing and deceit, and fraud: under his tongue is miſchief and vanity,</hi> verſe 7. Indeed it is a rare thing to hear a wicked man ſpeak well. <hi>For out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> ſaith our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Mat. 12. 34.</p>
               <p>But when the recollected Chriſtian beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſo ſpeechleſſe: That no corrupt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication will proceed out of his mouth:
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:123675:111"/> but that he putteth away all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evll ſpeaking, with all malice: And that he cannot ſuffer fornication, and uncleanneſs, and covetouſneſs to be once named, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther filthineſs, nor fooliſh talking, nor jeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which are not convenient. According to the ſeverall exhortations of the Apoſtle. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 29. 31. <hi>and</hi> 3, 4.</p>
               <p>I ſay the loſs of this, and the like ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly language, is another evident ſymptom, whereby we may pronounce ſuch a one to be dead unto ſin. A third ſign is loſs of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
               <p>It is a ſad thing to conſider what an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting memory a carnall man hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe things that are evill. He can ſooner forget a thouſand great benefits, then one ſmall offence. And ſo in all other particulars, his memory may be called, the ready Regiſter, by whom all his fleſh-plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vices are entered upon record.</p>
               <p>And when his opportunity will not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe him to commit them, it is no little recreation for him to remember them.</p>
               <p>The children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> wept, and ſaid: <hi>we remember the fiſh which we did eat in</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt <hi>freely; the Cucumbers and the Melons, and the Leekes, and the Onyons, and the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:123675:112"/> Numb. 11. 4, 5. But the children of <hi>Belial</hi> laugh and ſay, we remember ſince we could have ſatiated our luſts with variety of ſtrong fleſh: commanded the tongues, and hands of ſo many tall fellows: purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo many acres by meer policy, ſate ſo many dayes and nights together at game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: carouſed ſo many cups to a health, and ſpent ſo many crowns at a ſitting. Thus they delight their memories in the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of their own miſchiefs: <hi>As enemies to the croſſe of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>whoſe end is deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: whoſe</hi> God <hi>is their belly, whoſe glory is their ſhame, who mind earthly things.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>But when any one of theſe unhappy heads ſhall ſo loſe his memory, as that he ſhall forget thoſe delights, which he conceived in the time of his former lewdneſs: when the remembrance of all his fore-paſſed ſins is become ſo grievous and offenſive unto his ſoul: that he can cordially and conſtantly cry out with the Apoſtle: <hi>What fruit had I then in thoſe things, whereof I am now aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: for the end of thoſe things is death,</hi> Rom. 6. 21.</p>
               <p>Truely we may be confident to ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch a man; that he is dead unto ſin.</p>
               <pb n="211" facs="tcp:123675:112"/>
               <p> The fourth and laſt is a moſt infallible ſign, And that is loſs of motion.</p>
               <p>When a man hath ſo utterly forſaken the love of ſin, that he can by no means be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, or reſtored thereunto.</p>
               <p>The divell can no longer ſeduce him: The world cannot win him, neither can the luſts of the fleſh allure him: ſo far forth as to afford them any hope of his future obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: I will not ſay, but they may inforce their charming drugs upon him, as if one ſhould force drink into the mouth of a dead man. But his ſoul doth ſo extreamly abhor all means of recovery, that nothing will ſtay with him, nothing can work upon him.</p>
               <p>Haply the loſs of Appetite may be reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a skilfull Phyſitian: ſo may the loſs of ſpeech, and the loſs of memory too: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that the patient be willing to receive the medicine, and that his body is able to aſſiſt it. But when the patient will not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, or if his body cannot cooperate: we ſay that ſuch a man is abſolutely a dead man. Doubtleſs in every ſpirituall conflict the divell is very induſtrious to preſerve his declining patient.</p>
               <p>And to that purpoſe he preſenteth him with his guilded pills, and his perfumed
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:123675:113"/> potious, his cordials, and his reſtoratives: in expectation of a ſpeedy cure. But when the ſoul, perceiving his pretence, ſo ſets it ſelf againſt his blind Receipts: that nothing can move it, nothing work upon it, ſo as to return it to its former vomit.</p>
               <p>Then that happy body, that is the cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, or companion to ſuch a bleſſed ſoul: may chearfully give thanks <hi>unto the Father, which hath made him meet to be partaker of the inheritance of the Saints in light: having delivered him from the power of darkneſſe, and tranſlated him into the kingdom of his dear</hi> Son: <hi>In whom he hath redemption through his blood, even the forgivenneſſe of ſins.</hi> As in <hi>Collo.</hi> 1. 12, 13, 14.</p>
               <p>This man is undoubtedly dead indeed unto ſin: And ſo conſequently he is planted into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> according to the likeneſs of his death.</p>
               <p>And whoſoever is planted into <hi>Chriſt</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the likeneſs of his death: he is likewiſe planted into <hi>Chriſt</hi> according to the likeneſs of his reſurrection, as we have formerly obſerved out of thoſe words of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 5. But it may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: when a man may be ſaid, to be planted into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> according to the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his reſurrection?</p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:123675:113"/>
               <p> I anſwer: when he is alive unto <hi>God,</hi> through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> For as by the vertue of <hi>Chriſts</hi> death, we are dead unto ſin: ſo by the vertue of his reſurrection, we are alive unto <hi>God. Therefore we are buried with him by baptiſme into death: that like as</hi> Chriſt <hi>was raiſed up from the dead by the glory of the</hi> Father <hi>even ſo we alſo ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uld walk in newneſſe of life,</hi> Rom. 6. 4. And whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver walketh in newneſs of life upon the true account of a new creature: he onely is alive unto <hi>God,</hi> in, or through <hi>Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, it may be demanded: How a man may know, and aſſure himſelf, that he is planted into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> according to the likes neſs of his reſurrection. To which I anſwer.</p>
               <p>That this he ſhall finde by his reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, or likeneſs to this Tree of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, by which the <hi>Lord</hi> ſets forth a true Beleever.</p>
               <p>And therefore let him firſt conſider if he be well rooted. You know that when a tree is removed, it may be ſaid, to be dead, as in relation to that ground out of which it is taken; And therefore, that it may live again, it is neceſſary that it be replant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And for that purpoſe, the husbandman doth commonly make choice of a better,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:123675:114"/> and a more fertile ſoyl, then that from which it did Naturally or Originally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. That ſo it may be the more inrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the better inabled to ſpread forth its root, and to bring forth fruit accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p>And that it may appear to thrive, and proſper: the principall care to be taken is this. That it be well rooted, For the life of the plant conſiſteth in the root.</p>
               <p>We are all by nature unprofitable ſhoots, ſprung from old <hi>Adam:</hi> that degenerate ſhrub: and have neither roote, nor fatneſs, nor fruit in our ſelves: And therefore it is needfull that we be plucked from our corrupted ſtock; and that we be planted or graffed into the good olive tree: the ground and foundation of all our hopes, and happineſs: which is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> as that Apoſtle moſt excellently inſinuateth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17. <hi>to</hi> 25.</p>
               <p>And the roote whereby we ſtand is <hi>Faith:</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle in the ſame place, <hi>verſ.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>And to this purpoſe, he likewiſe exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>Coloſſians:</hi> That <hi>they be rooted and built up in</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and eſtabliſhed in the faith, Col.</hi> 2. 7. We may therefore conclude from the premiſſes, that whoſoever is deſirous
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:123675:114"/> to aſſure himſelf, that he is effectually plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> according to the likeneſs of his reſurrection: And ſo conſequently that he is an undoubted heir to that eternall Inheritance, as it appeareth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 6.</p>

               </p>
               <p>But you will ſay: how ſhall we do that? Truely the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath left us a very good rule for this purpoſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23.</p>
               <p>Where, having certified the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> of ſome ſpeciall benefits which they were to receive by <hi>Chriſt:</hi> he propoundeth unto them this condition. <hi>If ye continue in the faith</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>grounded, and ſetled, and be not moved away from the hope of the</hi> Goſpell.</p>
               <p>This is an excellent rule: and it is an elegant expreſſion, called by the Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:123675:115"/> 
                  <hi>Climax ſeu gradatio:</hi> a mounting to theſe four degrees. Firſt, we muſt continue in the faith. Secondly, we muſt be grounded in the faith. Thirdly, we muſt be ſetled in the faith, and Fourthly, not we muſt be moved away from the hope of the <hi>Goſpell:</hi> which in another place he calleth the <hi>word of faith:</hi> as, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 8.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is a good evidence that we are well rooted in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by faith, if we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the faith. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſpeaketh in his parable of the ſower; of ſome That <hi>receive the word with joy: but they have no roote: and therefore, though for a while they beleeve, yet in time of temptation they fall away,</hi> Luke 8. 13.</p>
               <p>You ſee that theſe are ſaid to beleeve for a while but they continue not in the faith: becauſe they have no roote. But if we be rooted in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by faith: we ſhall cortinue in the faith, we ſhall not be like the waves of the ſea, driven, and toſſed with everyſtorm of temptation: with St. <hi>James</hi> his double minded men, that are unſtable in all their wayes, <hi>James</hi> 1. 8.</p>
               <p>Nor like Weather-cocks, to turn our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes into every puff of opinion: with S. <hi>Pauls ſilly women laden with ſins, led away with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers luſts, ever learning, and never able to come</hi>

                  <hi>to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 6, 7. Neither ſhall we be any more like Children <hi>toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every winde of Doctrine, by the fleight of men, and cunning craftineſſe whereby they lie in wait to deceive,</hi> Eph. 4. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But building up our ſelves on our moſt holy faith, and praying in the holy Ghoſt: we ſhall keep our ſelves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal life,</hi> Jude 20. 21.</p>
               <p>They that will believe according to the times, or according to the men of the times, may ſometimes happen upon the right faith: but they will hardly continue any long time in the faith. <hi>Simon</hi> the <hi>Sorcerer believed, and was baptized alſo,</hi> Acts 8. 13. Yet when he failed in his ends, his faith alſo failed. Indeed, who would not be believers, or at leaſt, who would not pretend to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, being invited thereunto by ſuch plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible fair promiſes: As that they ſhall dip their feet in the bloud of their enemies, and tread them down like the mire in the ſtreets.</p>
               <p>That they ſhall ride on the high-places of the earth, and be the onely men of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and authority: That they ſhall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Lands and Lord-ſhips: And that they
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:123675:116"/> ſhall build great and fair houſes, and injoy them peaceably, powerfully, and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>
               <p>Would not the ſweet expectations of theſe, and the like glorious priviledges, and prerogatives tranſport the Souls of ſinners into the bodies of Saints: And make them believe, whenſoever, and whatſoever their Prophet pleaſeth? But how ſhall we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the faith, when theſe hopes fail us? Verily, theſe inducements unto faith are ſo proper to the fleſh, that I cannot imagine how they ſhould proceed from the <hi>Spirit:</hi> Or how they ſhould perſwade to any other then a temporary faith, being in themſelves ſo temporary, and uncertain. But eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, ſeeing they are ſo extreamly contrary to the lives, and Doctrine of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>For firſt, our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the time of his temporal life, was ſo far from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of revenge: that he prayed for his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enemies, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 34.</p>
               <p>So far from ambition, that he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of no reputation: and took upon him the form of a ſervant, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
               <p>So farre from covetouſneſſe, that rather then he would once yield unto the Devil: he refuſed all the Kingdoms of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:123675:116"/>
               <p> So far from the pleaſures of a Pallace: that he had not where to lay his head, <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 58.</p>
               <p>And ſo far from outward Pompe: <hi>That he was deſpiſed, and rejected of men, a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief: and we hid, as it were, our faces from him; he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 3.</p>
               <p>Neither were the lives of his Apoſtles much leſſe inglorious, or uncomfortable then that of their Maſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For I think that God hath ſet forth us the Apoſtles laſt, as it were men appointed to death, for we are made a ſpectacle to the world, and to Angels, and to men,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 9.</p>
               <p>And in the ſame Chapt. <hi>Being defamed, we intreat: we are made the filth of the world, and are the off-ſcouring of all things unto this day,</hi> verſe 13. And ſecondly, concerning their Doctrine: we finde that they directed the way by faith unto ſalvation, through difficulties, dangers, and diſtreſſes, and not through flattering, and fleſh-pleaſing feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Whoſoever will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his Croſſe and follow me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Mar. 8. 34.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever will come after <hi>Chriſt</hi> into his
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:123675:117"/> Kingdom of glory: he muſt deny himſelf of all his conceited deſerts, and in all his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſires: and he muſt take up his Croſſe, he muſt willingly ſubmit to all manner of afflictions: And he muſt follow <hi>Jeſus</hi> his <hi>Lord</hi> general in his Kingdom of grace: he muſt not fail, or faint by the way, but, hold on his courſe with a conſtant and continual confidence.</p>
               <p>And in the 24. of <hi>Mat.</hi> at the 9. <hi>verſe,</hi> and ſo forwards, he acquainteth his Diſciples with more particular ingagements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They ſhall deliver you up to be afflicted,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and ſhall kill you, and ye ſhall be hated of all Nations, for my name ſake. And then ſhall many be offended, and ſhall betray one another, and ſhall hate one another. And many falſe Prophets ſhall ariſe, and deceive many. And becauſe iniquity ſhall abound, the love of many ſhall wax cold. But he that ſhall endure to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved,</hi> verſe 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And unto the Angel of the Church in</hi> Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na: <hi>Fear none of thoſe things which thou ſhalt ſuffer: behold, the Devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon, that ye may be tried, and ye ſhall have tribulation ten dayes: be thou faithfull unto death, and I will give thee a Crown of life,</hi> Rev. 2. 10.</p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:123675:117"/>
               <p> In like manner the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Souls of the Diſciples, tells them: <hi>That we muſt through much tribulation enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Acts 14. 22.</p>
               <p>And thus the Apoſtle <hi>Peter: Beloved,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Think it not ſtrange concerning the fiery trial, which is to try you: as though ſome ſtrange thing hapned unto you. But rejoyce, in as much as ye are partakers of Chriſts ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: that when his glory ſhall be revealed, ye may be glad alſo with exceeding joy,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 12. 13.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay: Theſe are ſad invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, either to perſwade unto faith, or to continue in the faith. I anſwer, that I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not if they ſeem ſo to a common appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion: to ſuch a one as is led meerly by ſenſe, and the light of nature: unto which theſe things are ſo extreamly irkſome and offenſive.</p>
               <p>But if we ſhall take the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> for our guide, and ſhall thereby be inabled to judge, <hi>not according to the appearance, but to judge righteous judgement: as our Lord advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,</hi> Joh. 7. 24.</p>
               <p>We ſhall then finde that theſe ſad-ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preparations do proceed from very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary principles. For afflictions and croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of all kindes do firſt direct us towards faith.</p>
               <pb n="222" facs="tcp:123675:118"/>
               <p> Secondly, they do bring us unto faith.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, they doe continue us in faith.</p>
               <p>Firſt (I ſay) they do direct us towards faith: and that through theſe three paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages: As firſt, through making us ſenſible of our ſins. When the Sons of <hi>Jacob</hi> were diſtreſſed in the Land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> they then conſidered the ſin, that they had many years before committed againſt their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Joſeph</hi> in the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And they ſaid one to another: <hi>we are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his Soul, when he beſought us, and we would not hear: therefore is this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe come upon us,</hi> Gen. 42. 21.</p>
               <p>And thus the Church in the Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: <hi>Woe unto us that we have ſinned, for this our heart is faint, for theſe things our eyes are dim,</hi> Lam. 5. 16. 17. Secondly, through humbling us for our ſinnes. This we ſee in the example of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> who (being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly of an abominable converſation) yet when he was in affliction: <hi>he beſought the Lord his God, and humbled himſelf greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the God of his fathers,</hi> 2 Chron. 33. 12.</p>
               <p>And in that confeſſion of his Church: <hi>We lie down in our ſhame, and our confuſion cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, for we have ſinned againſt the Lord our</hi>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:123675:118"/> 
                  <hi>God,</hi> Jer. 3. 25. And thirdly, through break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us off from the courſe of our former er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours and iniquities. <hi>Bofore I was afflicted I went aſtray: but now have I kept thy word,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. 62.</p>
               <p>And the ſame Prophet ſpeaking concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the wicked, <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall hear, and afflict them: for, becauſe they have no changes, therefore they fear not God,</hi> Pſal. 55. 19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, diſtreſſes, and afflictions do lead us unto faith, and that by ſhewing us the unhappineſſe of the world, and of all worldly expectations, either inward, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in our ſelves, or from others: And ſo by ſending us to the <hi>Lord</hi> for ſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. <hi>My fleſh, and my heart faileth me: but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever,</hi> ſaith good <hi>David,</hi> Pſ. 73. 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Son diſhonoureth the Father, the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther riſeth up againſt her Mother: the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Law, againſt her Mother in Law, a mans enemies are the men of his own houſe: Therefore I will look unto the Lord, I will wait for the God of my ſalvation, my God will hear me,</hi> ſaith his afflicted Church, <hi>Mic.</hi> 7. 6, 7. When the ſhip is covered with Waves: then the Diſciples run unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſaying: <hi>Lord ſave us, we periſh,</hi> Mat. 8. 25.</p>
               <pb n="224" facs="tcp:123675:119"/>
               <p> And he, whom we call the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> being pinched by the extremity of want, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, reſolved to return unto his father, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 18. And thirdly, corrections, or afflictions do continue us in the faith: by aſſuring us of <hi>Gods</hi> love, and fatherly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</p>
               <p>In diſpoſing of our afflictions,</p>
               <p>In comforting us in our afflictions. And,</p>
               <p>In delivering us out of our afflictions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in diſpoſing our afflictions, or in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiting us with afflictions, as fatherly chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: <hi>For whom the Lord loveth he chaſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth: If ye endure chaſtening, God dealeth with you as with Sons, for what Son is he whom the Father chaſteneth not? But if ye be without chaſtiſement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye Baſtards, and not Sons,</hi> Hebr. 12. 6, 7, 8. And, <hi>as many as I love, I rebuke; and chaſten,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Son of God,</hi> Rev. 3. 19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, afflictions do continue us in the faith, by aſſuring us of <hi>Gods</hi> love in comforting us in our afflictions. <hi>In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his preſence ſaved them: in his love, and in his pity he redeemed them, and he bare them, and carried them all the dayes of old,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 9.</p>
               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:123675:119"/>
               <p> And thus the Apoſtle: <hi>Bleſſed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort: who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort, wherewith we are comforted of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 3, 4. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by aſſuring us of <hi>Gods</hi> love, in delivering us out of our afflictions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Many are the afflictions of the righte us, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all,</hi> Pſal. 34. 19.</p>
               <p>And the ſame Prophet having recorded many great deliverances, which the <hi>Lord</hi> uſually worketh for his people in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral diſtreſſes, and extremities in his 107. <hi>Pſalm:</hi> he concludeth with this Rule of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: <hi>whoſo is wiſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve thoſe things, even they ſhall underſtand the loving kindneſſe of the Lord,</hi> verſe 43.</p>
               <p>And he that rightly underſtandeth the loving kindneſſe of the <hi>Lord:</hi> will certainly rely upon him, by faith, as an everlaſting, and infallible refuge.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay: Is this all the happineſſe that a <hi>Believer</hi> muſt expect in this life? Doth not the Apoſtle tell us: That <hi>godlineſſe is profitable unto all things, having promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come?</hi>
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:123675:120"/> 1 Tim. 4. 8. To the firſt part of this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I anſwer. That there is ſuch ſolid hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe in affliction well qualified: as none, but a true <hi>Believer</hi> can rightly apprehend, and therefore I will referre the cenſure to ſuch a one, as the onely competent Judge in this caſe. And to the ſecond part, I anſwer. That without doubt the Apoſtle did ſpeak no other, then what was dictated unto him by the <hi>Spirit of God:</hi> that holy <hi>Spirit,</hi> that never deluded nor deceived any man. But let us take heed, that we deceive not our ſelves by expecting other kindes, or degrees of profit, then the <hi>Lord</hi> in his wiſdom ſees to be beneficial for us. <hi>Serve the Lord with all your heart, and turn ye not aſide, for then ſhould ye go after vaine things, which cannot profit, nor deliver,</hi> ſaith <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 Sam. 12. 20.</p>
               <p>And for the promiſe of the life that now is, (or of the things belonging to the life that now is) we muſt know, that we may not be altogether our own carvers: But muſt willingly ſubmit our ſelves unto the Lord: both for the time, the quality, and the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity. <hi>Jacob, Joſeph, David,</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> in general; were ſervants, and greatly diſtreſſed, before they came to be Maſters and men of Authority. <hi>Job, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decay,</hi>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:123675:120"/> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> were more proſperous in their beginning, and end: then in their middle age. <hi>Lot, Aſa,</hi> and <hi>Joſiah</hi> ſeemed moſt unhappy in, and towards the end of their dayes. Yet theſe were all approved of <hi>God:</hi> and ſuch upon whom he beſtowed very remarkable favours.</p>
               <p>Neither do I remember any of <hi>Gods</hi> moſt ſucceſſefull ſervants, that ſuffered not their ſeveral interruptions, or alterations in their outward happineſſe, either at one time, or another: <hi>who will appoint me the time?</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord,</hi> Jer. 5. 44.</p>
               <p>And therefore every good Chriſtian will ſay unto the <hi>Lord</hi> with the Prophet <hi>David: My times are in thy hand,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 15.</p>
               <p>Secondly, for the quality: Peradventure the deareſt Childe of <hi>God</hi> may ſometimes deſire ſuch things, as are very inconvenient. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> that good King deſired to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for his precious things: his Silver, and his Gold, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 13. But it threatned the ruine of his poſterity, ver. 18. And that godly King <hi>Joſiah</hi> deſired a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over <hi>Necho,</hi> King of <hi>Egypt:</hi> But he ſought his own deſtruction: For thereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his deaths wound in the valley of <hi>Megiddo,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35. 22. <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> the Sons of <hi>Zebedee,</hi> and the Diſciples of
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:123675:121"/> 
                  <hi>Chriſt</hi> deſired that they might ſit, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left, in his glory, <hi>Mar.</hi> 10. 37. But he anſwered, ye know not what ye ask, <hi>verſe</hi> 38.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Peter</hi> the Apoſtle deſired to know more of his <hi>Lords</hi> minde, then his <hi>Lord</hi> was minded to reveal, and was reproved with: <hi>what is that to thee?</hi> John 21. 22.</p>
               <p>We ſee here, that there are miſtakes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the godly: But what may be expected from ſuch, as ſuppoſe that gain is godlineſs? Truely, it is to be ſuſpected, that riches, honour, and preferment, with the like out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward additions have made many <hi>ſeekers. For all ſeek their own, not the things which are Jeſus Chriſts,</hi> Phil. 2. 21.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay, but a man may deſire a competency, or a ſufficiency, agreeable to his calling, or condition: but not primarily, or principally. <hi>Seek ye firſt the kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſſe: and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Mat. 6. 33.</p>
               <p>Lay hold on the ſubſtance, and then doubt not of the circumſtance. <hi>For it is the Lord that maketh poor, and maketh rich,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 7.</p>
               <p>But <hi>they that will be rich, fall into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a ſnare, and into many fooliſh, and</hi>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:123675:121"/> 
                  <hi>hurtfull luſts, which drown men in deſtruction and perdition,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 9.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, concerning the quantity: It is a rare thing for a man to ſee, when he hath enough: we ſay, much would have more. Yet commonly the more we have, the leſs good we do with it, and the more loath we are to part from it. We conſume our dayes in hunting after increaſe: and (though we live never ſo long) yet we die unſatisfied. <hi>He that loveth ſilver, ſhall not be ſatisfied mith ſilver: nor he that loveth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance with increaſe.</hi> Saith the preacher, <hi>Ecleſ.</hi> 5. 10.</p>
               <p>Whereas if we could truely conſider that of our <hi>Saviour</hi> where he ſaith: <hi>A mans life</hi> (or the happineſs of a mans life) <hi>conſiſteth not in the abundance of the things: which he poſſeſſeth,</hi> Luke 12. 15. Certainly our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation would be more without cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs: and we ſhould be better content with ſuch things as we have, ſeeing the <hi>Lord</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee.</hi> According to that of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. This is a ſore evil under the ſun: yea even among the ſaints of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Baruch</hi> the Scribe was faithfull unto the <hi>Lord:</hi> yet he deſired more then the <hi>Lord</hi> was pleaſed to allow him: And therefore
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:123675:122"/> the <hi>Lord</hi> ſent <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to ſay unto him. <hi>Seekeſt thou great things for thy ſelf? ſeek them not: for behold I will bring evil upon all fleſh, ſaith the</hi> Lord, <hi>but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places whither thou goeſt,</hi> Jer. 45. 5.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay but a rich man may be a true beleever. But <hi>charge them, that are rich in this world, that they be not high minded, nor truſt in uncertain riches: but in the living</hi> God, <hi>who giveth us richly all things to enjoy: That they do good, that they be rich in good works: ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate: laying up in ſtore for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they lay hold on eternall life.</hi> Saith <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy:</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 17, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, that though it is very true, that godlineſs is profitable unto all things, having promiſe of the life that now is: yet the beſt of <hi>Gods</hi> people may deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves either in the time, the quality, or the quantity. And therefore it is neceſſary, that we moderate our deſires: or rather that we refer them wholy to <hi>Gods</hi> all-ſeeing and all-ſearching wiſdom.</p>
               <p>And whoſoever ſhall thus continue in the faith, by patient waiting upon the <hi>Lord</hi> in time of Adverſity: and by moderating his
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:123675:122"/> affections in time of proſperity, with this confidence, that whatſoever he doth or ſuffereth, it is all through <hi>Chriſt</hi> which ſtrengtheneth him. It is a very good ſign, that he is well rooted in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by faith.</p>

               <p>And well may the Apoſtle call it the glorious <hi>Goſpel:</hi> not onely in regard that it bringeth us unto glory, or for that <hi>God</hi> is ſo much glorified thereby.

               </p>
               <p>Then came there a voice from heaven ſaying: <hi>I have both glorified it, and will glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie it again,</hi> Jo. 12. 27, 28. I have both glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified it from everlaſting, and I will glorifie it again to everlaſting.</p>
               <p>And excellent to this purpoſe is that of the Apoſtle. <hi>Ye are bought with a price</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>therefore glorifie</hi> God <hi>in your body, and in your Spirit, which are</hi> Gods, 1 Cor. 6. 20.</p>

               <p>Sixthly, he juſtifieth us for his own glory. <hi>Thy people ſhall be all righteous: they ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the land for ever, the branch of my plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the work of my hands, that I may be glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> ſaith the ſame <hi>God,</hi> Iſa. 50. 21.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, he ſanctifieth us for his own glory. <hi>I am the true Vine</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Son of God) and my Father is the husband-man, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry branch in me that beareth not fruit, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit,</hi> John 15. 1, 2.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit.</hi> And <hi>this I pray</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul) that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge, and in all judgement.

                  <hi>which are by Jeſus Chriſt, unto the praiſe, and glory of God,</hi> Phil. 1. 9, 10, 11.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, it is for his glory, that he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth us. <hi>Father</hi> (ſaith our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt) I will that they alſo, whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory, which thou haſt given me,</hi> Joh. 17. 24.

               <p>See here how infinitely the glory of <hi>God</hi> is intereſſed in all his Evangelical actions, and conceſſions: As namely, in his Election, Redemption, Creation, Preſervation, Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Juſtification, Sanctification, and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sons of men.</p>
               <p>And doeſt thou want a ſure ground for thy faith? Caſt away all execrable opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of humane perfections, and performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>As truely as I live, all the earth ſhall be filled with the glory of the Lord,</hi> ſaith Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>God,</hi> Numb. 14. 21.</p>
               <p>Ingage thy Soul therefore boldly upon this eternal deſign of <hi>Gods</hi> glory: with this aſſurance, that it can never periſh: ſo long as the <hi>God</hi> of all power, and glory is able to preſerve it.</p>
               <p>This (I am confident) is the ſoundeſt,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:123675:125"/> and the moſt ſubſtantial foundation, that any Chriſtian can build upon: having its Warrant from the manifold wiſdom of <hi>God.</hi> Ground thy ſelf therefore firmly thereupon: and then doubt not, but thou art well root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by faith.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, to be ſetled in the faith: is a very good argument, that we are well root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by faith. To be ſetled: that is, to be confirmed, or eſtabliſhed in the faith: according to that of this Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 7.</p>
               <p>And this is done chiefly by obſervation, and experience. Doeſt thou deſire to be ſetled in the faith? Obſerve <hi>Gods</hi> mercy, and loving kindneſſe towards thee: Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thine honeſt endeavours in the works of thy lawfull calling: bleſſing thee in thy perſon, and in thy poſterity, providing for thy neceſſities, preſerving thee from thine enemies, comforting thee in all thine affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, delivering thee out of thy diſtreſſes, and graciouſly anſwering thee in thy fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayers, and ſupplications. But eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, conſider what great things <hi>God</hi> hath done to thy Soul. In weaning it from the world, redeeming it from the bondage of ſin, and Satan: Tranſlating it from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe unto light, ſupplying it with good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and godly deſires, fixing it firmly
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:123675:125"/> upon thy <hi>Lord and Saviour:</hi> And working it to the willing obedience of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love.</hi> If thou ſhalt thus apply thy ſelf to ſee the good hand of <hi>God</hi> upon thee, and to feel the ſweet influence of his holy <hi>Spirit</hi> within thee. Thou ſhalt come to know <hi>God</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally. Thou ſhall <hi>know, that thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt him.</hi> According to that of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 3.</p>

               <p>With <hi>Paul,</hi> Thou ſhalt know the <hi>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and the power of his reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſufferings, being made conformable unto his death,</hi> Phil. 3. 10.</p>
               <p>And thou ſhalt know, that if <hi>thine earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houſe of this Tabernacle were diſſolved, thou haſt a building of God, an houſe not made with hands, eternal in the heavens:</hi> with the ſame Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1.</p>
               <p>And when theſe, and the like obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have brought thee to this, and the like experience. And experience hath ſetled thee in the faith: Then thou ſhalt know likewiſe, that thou art well rooted in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by <hi>faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, we muſt not be moved away
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:123675:126"/> from the hope of the Goſpel: This is the laſt ſign expreſſed in this gradation.</p>
               <p>The Devil hath fear, but no hope: The Reprobate hath hope, but no fear: I mean no filial fear. He may ſometimes in ſpight of his heart, fear to appear in <hi>Gods</hi> preſence, as he is a juſt Judge. But he cannot at any time, or by any means fear to offend <hi>God,</hi> as he is a loving <hi>Father:</hi> for he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him ſo to be, he cannot rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend him under that notion upon any preſent condition whatſoever.</p>
               <p>And as his fear is commonly deſperate, ſo his hope, is alwayes doubtfull and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. He is ſoon moved away from his hope; for his hope is not the <hi>Hope</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the true <hi>Believer</hi> cannot be moved away from the <hi>Hope</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> It is the <hi>ſure and ſteadfaſh Anchor of his Soul,</hi> Hebr. 6. 19.</p>
               <p>I cannot ſay, but a ſhip, when ſhe rideth at Anchor, may be tumbled, and toſſed by a violent Tempeſt: yet ſo long as her An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor continueth firm and ſtedy, ſhe rideth ſecurely, be the ſtorm never ſo outragious: But if her Anchor faileth her, her danger is dreadfull, eſpecially if the Channel where ſhe rideth be Rocky, narrow, or otherwiſe unſafe.</p>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:123675:126"/>
               <p> Even ſo the Soul, that is ſuſtained by Hope, may peradventure be moved, or ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by ſome ſtrong diſtemper. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, ſo long as her hope remaineth ſound, ſetled, and ſtedfaſt: ſhe is able to bear up in the greateſt extremity. But if ſhe be quite moved away from the hope of the Goſpel; 'tis dangerous that ſhe is loſt for ever.</p>
               <p>And the rather, for that the whole Ocean is not ſo full of Rocks, and ſhowls, &amp; quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, wherewith to bulge, and break a cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie veſſel, as the wild world is full of ſnares, offences, and temptations to ruine, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a ſilly Soul.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay: what is the difference between an ordinary <hi>Hope,</hi> and this <hi>Hope</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel?</hi> I anſwer, that an ordinary hope is commonly carnall: but this hope of the Goſpel is altogether ſpiritual.</p>
               <p>And they differ in theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in their <hi>Authour:</hi> The carnal hope proceedeth of the Devil, or Satan. It was he, that gave hope to the woman, that ſhe ſhould not die in her tranſgreſſion, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 3. 4.</p>
               <p>It was he, that gave <hi>Ahab</hi> hope of good ſucceſſe, 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 22. 21.</p>
               <p>And it was Satan that filled the heart of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:123675:127"/> 
                  <hi>Ananias,</hi> with hope that his Hypocriſie ſhould not be diſcovered, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 3.</p>
               <p>And he feeds, and fills us with theſe falſe hopes, in his malice, and emnity to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde: <hi>For he is our adverſary, who as a roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lion walketh about, ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 Peter 5. 8.</p>
               <p>But it is <hi>God</hi> that giveth us this Goſpel-hope, and that of his love, and grace. <hi>It is our Lord Ieſus Chriſt himſelf, and God even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us everlaſting conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Secondly, they differ in their <hi>foundation:</hi> The carnal hope is commonly built upon caſualties, upon perhaps, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But this Goſpel hope is built upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that never-failing foundation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The riches of the glorie of this myſtery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles, is Chriſt in us the hope of glorie,</hi> Col. 1. 27.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they differ in their <hi>objects:</hi> The carnal hope aimes altogether at riches, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, pleaſures, long life, or the like world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:123675:127"/> injoyments, <hi>vanity of vanities</hi> (ſaith the preacher) <hi>vanity of vanities; all is vanitie, Eccleſ.</hi> 1, 2. But the Goſpel hope looks upon the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which is our hope,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 1. And <hi>eternal life which</hi> God, <hi>that cannot lye, promiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world began,</hi> Tit. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>Or if ſhe meets with any worldly good, as neceſſary to this preſent life: ſhe lookes upon it, not as a reward, but as a bleſſing from her <hi>God in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, they differ in their <hi>evidence</hi> For what hath a carnall man to ſhew for all his hopes, but onely his own blinde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and imaginations: whereas the Goſpel hope is evidenced by <hi>Gods</hi> holy word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For whatſoever things were written afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, were written for our learning: that we through patience and comfort of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures might have hope,</hi> Rom. 15. 4.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, they differ in their <hi>effects:</hi> for the carnall hope doth onely ſerve to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den us in ſin, and ſo to run us up to ruine, and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But every man that hath this hope in him</hi> (this Goſpel hope) <hi>he purifieth himſelf, even as</hi> God <hi>is pure,</hi> 1 John 3. 3.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, they differ in their <hi>alliance</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:123675:128"/> or ſociety: The carnall hope confederates it ſelf with doubts, diſtruſts, and a diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſcience. And therefore <hi>Zophar</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Job: That the hope of the wicked ſhall be as the giving up of the Ghoſt,</hi> Job. 11. 20. But this <hi>Goſpel</hi> hope is the companion of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and that unto the benefit of both. For as this <hi>hope</hi> ſupporteth and ſuſtaineth her mother <hi>faith</hi> in her tedious travail towards eternal happineſs. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſhe comforteth and confirmeth her ſiſter <hi>love,</hi> by aſſuring her that her labour is not in vain in the <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore the Apoſtle hath moſt fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed her between them both, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13, 13.</p>
               <p>Having thus conſidered this <hi>Rule</hi> of the Apoſtle according to the four degrees thereof: we finde. That whoſoever conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nueth in the <hi>faith,</hi> even in the furnace of affliction.</p>
               <p>That groundeth his <hi>faith</hi> upon that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall deſign of <hi>Gods glory.</hi> That is ſetled in the <hi>faith</hi> by the conſtant obſervation, and experience of the favour and loving kindneſs of <hi>God in Chriſt:</hi> And is not moved away from the <hi>hope</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> He may without any doubt aſſure himſelf: That he is well rooted in <hi>Chriſt</hi> by <hi>Faith.</hi>

               </p>

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:123675:129"/> ſincerity, which without <hi>Love,</hi> are dull, deceitfull, and hypocriticall.</p>
               <p>I cannot well tell, where I ſhould begin, or how to end in the juſt commendations of this incomparable bleſſing. There are many affections, or ſtrong, and powerfull motions of the minde, as joy: grief, Hope, Fear, Hatred, and the like. But when affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is ſimply, and ſingularly, nominated, without any other addition: you know we take it uſually for <hi>Love.</hi> By which we may conceive and underſtand that <hi>Love</hi> is the abſolute affection. It is alſo ſaid, that a good thing the more common it is, the better it is: And love is common unto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very creature, that onely hath the benefit of ſenſe: They do all generally love them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their ſeed, their food, their fellows, and their friends: or whatſoever is moſt precious to their inſtinct or inclination. Yet <hi>Love</hi> in man is of a nobler ſtrain, in regard that it proceedeth, or ſhould proceed from reaſon, and diſcretion: But when this <hi>Love,</hi> extracted by true <hi>faith</hi> from <hi>God</hi> the onely ſubſtance of pure <hi>Love,</hi> is placed upon <hi>God in Chriſt,</hi> and the image of <hi>God</hi> in man: The onely ſound and unſuſpected Objects, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 37, 38.</p>
               <p>Then verily it is of wondrous uſe.</p>
               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:123675:129"/>
               <p> Firſt, it becomes the nourſe of pregnant <hi>faith,</hi> to cheriſh; and improve her precious fruit, ſtrengthening, decking, and beautify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every infant grace, which would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe grow crooked, deformed, and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible.</p>
               <p>'Tis <hi>faith</hi> that ſeales our intereſt in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> But ſuch a <hi>faith</hi> as works by <hi>Love,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul</hi> Gala. 5, 6. <hi>Faith if it hath not works is dead, ſaith</hi> James <hi>Ja.</hi> 2. 17. Yet <hi>Faith</hi> with works is nothing without <hi>Love;</hi> as ſaith believing, working, loving <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 2, 3.</p>
               <p>True <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> have ſuch a ſtrict re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, they cannot live the one without the other. And therefore if our <hi>Love</hi> be not ſincere we have great reaſon to ſuſpect our <hi>faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in the ſecond place we finde that <hi>Love</hi> is <hi>Chriſt</hi> his cogniſance or livery, whereby he will have his Diſciples known.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>By this ſhall all men know ye are my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if ye have love one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Jo. 13. 15.</p>
               <p>And it is a moſt compleat robe, it hideth all our infirmities, and deformities: yea all our ſins, and tranſgreſſions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Love covereth all ſins ſaith</hi> Solomon, <hi>Pro.</hi> 10. 12.</p>
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:123675:130"/>
               <p> And therefore bleſſed is the man, that weares it. <hi>Bleſſed is he, whoſe tranſgreſſion is forgiven, and whoſe ſin is covered.</hi> Pſa. 32. 1.</p>
               <p>This, in all likeneſs, is that wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for want of which, the Intruder was caſt out of the bride chamber, into utter darkneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 12, 13. And it is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Ornament: It never faileth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>faith</hi> and Hope, will help us into heaven, and there they leave us: but our endleſs <hi>Love</hi> will enter with us, where it ſhall ſurpaſs in ſtrength, in ſweetneſs, and perfection: as much as having exceedeth hopeing, or injoying excelleth believing.</p>
               <p>But every one, that loves himſelf, will ſay: though <hi>Love</hi> be ſuch a precious livery, yet it is not ſo coſtly as 'tis common.</p>
               <p>I hope we are not ſo ungracious, or ſo ungratefull, but we love the <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe wiſe <hi>Solomon</hi> informs us That <hi>he that truſteth in his own heart, is a fool,</hi> Pro. 28. 26. And therefore let not us delude our ſelves in matters of ſuch infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite concernment: by truſting to our own deceitfull hearts, without a ſerious exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>We ſhall not finde it ſo eaſie a matter to lovc <hi>God</hi> really, as moſt men unadviſedly imagine.</p>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:123675:130"/>
               <p> For firſt our <hi>Love</hi> is as narrow as <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ds</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection: <hi>Gods</hi> election is the firſt wheel, that moveth in this great work. It is he, That <hi>hath choſen us in</hi> Chriſt <hi>before the foundation of the world; that we ſhould be holy, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blame before him in love,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 4.</p>
               <p>And therefore, untill we have given di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to make our <hi>election</hi> ſure, by inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into the ſoundneſs of our <hi>faith:</hi> we have great reaſon to ſuſpect our <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, if we have not the <hi>Spirit of God:</hi> we have not the love of <hi>God:</hi> For <hi>Love</hi> is a prime fruit of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. 22.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, if we do not love the children of <hi>God:</hi> we do not love <hi>God, For every one that loveth him that begat: loveth him alſo, that is begotten of him,</hi> 1 John 5. 1.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, if we do not keep <hi>Gods</hi> words, we do not love <hi>God. For if any man love me he will keep my words,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Son of God, John</hi> 14. 23.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, if we be not carefull to keep <hi>Gods</hi> commandments, we do not love <hi>God: For this is the love of</hi> God <hi>that we keep his commandments,</hi> 1 John 5. 3.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, if our hearts be not circumciſed, if our hearts be not broken, and humbled for ſin, ſo that our carnall corruptions are mortified, and our ſinfull luſts, and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:123675:131"/> ſubdued, in ſome good meaſure, we cannot love <hi>God. For the</hi> Lord <hi>thy</hi> God <hi>will circumciſe thine heart, to love the</hi> Lord <hi>thy</hi> God <hi>with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoul,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> that man of <hi>God</hi> Deut, 30. 6.</p>
               <p>And Seaventhly, if we do love the world; we do not love <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If any man love the world, the love of the</hi> Father <hi>is not in him,</hi> 1 John 2. 15.</p>
               <p>Now it will be neceſſary for us to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our ſelves in order to theſe ſeaven particulars: And if we ſhall then preſume that we love <hi>God:</hi> we are in the next place to conſider, what manner of <hi>Love</hi> it is, wherewith we do love him.</p>
               <p>For we muſt know, that there is a falſe <hi>Love,</hi> as well as there is a true <hi>Love:</hi> the love of an harlot, as well as the love of a virgin. The love of an harlot, is Firſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary: ſecondly hypocriticall, thirdly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, and fourthly contemptible.</p>
               <p>Firſt, I ſay, the love of an harlot is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenery, when <hi>Tamar</hi> deceived <hi>Judah</hi> by playing the harlot ſhe ſaid unto him <hi>what wilt thou give me?</hi> Gen. 38. 16.</p>
               <p>And probably there may be many, that do ſeem even unto themſelves to love <hi>God</hi> very dearly: when as yet the ſecret inquiſition of their heart, is: what ſhall we get by it?
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:123675:131"/> what pleaſure, what profit, what prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: They ſay with the wicked, <hi>what can the almighty do for them,</hi> Job. 22. 17. <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> will go to the Prophet in <hi>Samaria,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5. 9. But it ſhall be to be cleanſed of his outward leproſie: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cleanſed: he will thenceforth offer nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther burnt-offering nor ſacrifice unto other gods, but to the <hi>Lord,</hi> verſ. 17. <hi>But in this thing the</hi> Lord <hi>pardon thy ſervant</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that when my maſter goeth into the houſe of</hi> Rimmon <hi>to worſhip there, and he leaneth on my hand: and I bow my ſelf in the houſe of</hi> Rimmon, <hi>when I bow down my ſelf in the houſe of</hi> Rimmon: <hi>The</hi> Lord <hi>pardon thy ſervant in this thing,</hi> verſe 18. He will be ſtill an ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>later, rather then he will loſe the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the king his maſter. This is the mercenary love of an harlot, for which the Divell accuſed <hi>Job:</hi> though very injuriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Job.</hi> 1. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the love of an harlot is hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticall: doubtleſs <hi>Sampſons</hi> harlot <hi>Dalila</hi> did profeſs very much affection towards him, before ſhe could win him to tell her, wherewith he might certainly be bound: But if her love had been reall and ſincere, ſhe would not have delivered him into the hands of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> As <hi>Jud.</hi> 16. 18, &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="250" facs="tcp:123675:132"/>
               <p> This was <hi>Judas</hi> his charity to the poor, <hi>Jo.</hi> 12. 4. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And his love to his <hi>Lord, Mat.</hi> 26. 49.</p>
               <p>And this is the love of all ſuch as will ſerve both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Mammon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the love of an harlot is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, when <hi>God</hi> complained of <hi>Judah</hi> for her inconſtancy, and apoſtacy: <hi>Thou haſt played the harlot</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with many lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> Jer. 3. 1.</p>
               <p>And truly that love, which is mercenary, muſt needs be unconſtant: that which was bought, will be ſold: The love of a poor paſſive <hi>Chriſt</hi> will never continue long in a mercenary boſom. And whoſoever loveth <hi>God,</hi> for giving: will ceaſe to love, if <hi>God</hi> ſhall ceaſe to give, or at leaſt, if he ſhall take away that, which he formerly did give.</p>
               <p>This is one of the Divells ſureſt weapons, and it is to be feared, that there are but few <hi>Jobs</hi> to beat him at it.</p>
               <p>And laſtly the love of an harlot becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth contemptible. <hi>Thus ſaith the</hi> Lord: <hi>becauſe thy filthineſs was poured out, and thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs diſcovered through thy whordoms with thy lovers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Behold therefore I will gather all thy lovers, with wbom thou haſt taken pleaſure: and all them which thou haſt loved, with all them that thou haſt hated: I will even gather</hi>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:123675:132"/> 
                  <hi>them round about againſt thee: and will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover thy nakedneſs unto them, and they ſhall ſee all thy nakedneſs,</hi> Ezek. 16. 36, 37. <hi>And I will alſo give thee into their hand,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſe</hi> 39.</p>
               <p>And, to conclude with this particular, obſerve the ſhamefull end of <hi>Jezebel,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 9. 30. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But the virgins love is of another nature, <hi>Becauſe of the favour of thy good oyntments, thy name is as ointment poured forth: therefore do the virgins love thee,</hi> ſaith the chaſte ſpouſe unto her loving <hi>Lord</hi> Chap. 1. 3.</p>
               <p>You know that a pleaſant ſent or ſavour hath nothing that is outwardly beneficiall: but being drawn in with the breath, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſheth, and comforteth the inward parts.</p>
               <p>And oyntment, or unction, or anoynting, do ſignifie unto us the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 20.</p>
               <p>Wherewith their bleſſed <hi>Bridegroom</hi> was anointed to be their <hi>Prieſt,</hi> their <hi>Prophet,</hi> and their <hi>King:</hi> And by the influence of the ſame <hi>Spirit,</hi> the very name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> infuſeth both life, and ſweetneſſe into all his Saints, and therefore do their Virgin chaſte Souls love him. Thus it appeareth that the Virgins <hi>Love</hi> unto her <hi>Lord</hi> is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her mercenary, nor carnal: but moſt pure,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:123675:133"/> and ſpiritual. And it is moſt excellently compleated through theſe four paſſages.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, it is improved by <hi>Contemplation.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, it is manifeſted by <hi>Profeſſion.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Thirdly, it is confirmed by <hi>Preparation.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>And fourthly, it is perfected by <hi>Practice.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>When a chaſt Virgin firſt begins to love, her heart delighteth much in <hi>Contemplation:</hi> Her thoughts are very much upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of her affections, alwayes meditating upon his amiable perſon, his outward great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and his inward graces. In his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhe conſidereth the beauties, or come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of his countenance, and compoſition.</p>
               <p>In his outward greatneſſe, ſhe reflecteth upon his birth, his wealth, his power, deſerts, and dignities. Concerning his inward gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſhe recordeth his love, his goodneſſe, his mercy, truth, Juſtice, and wiſdom.</p>
               <p>With theſe, and with the like ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations ſhe feeds her fancies, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments her fires: <hi>For the coals of love are coals of fire, which hath a moſt vehement flame,</hi> Cant. 8. 6.</p>
               <p>By this poor ſcantling you may partly aim at things that are incomprehenſible.</p>
               <p>Thus the ſweet Soul, that is in love with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with <hi>God in Chriſt,</hi> revolves her amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thoughts, firſt on the perſon of her
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:123675:133"/> 
                  <hi>Lord</hi> and Lover. <hi>Thou art fairer then the children of men</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45. 2.</p>
               <p>Of this you ſhall finde a moſt elegant, and excellent deſcription, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 10. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Where ſhe ſetteth forth his beauty, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſtrength, and lovelineſſe by way of alluſion, or ſimilitude. <hi>My beloved</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>is white, and ruddy, the chiefeſt among ten thouſand: his head is as the moſt fine Gold, his locks are buſhy, and black as a Raven, his eyes are as the eyes of Doves by the Rivers of water, waſhed with Milk, and fitly ſet: His cheeks are as a bed of ſpices, as ſweet flowers, his lips like lilies, dropping ſweet ſmelling myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhe, his hands are as Gold rings ſet with the beril, his belly is as bright Ivory overlaid with Saphires, his legs are as pillars of Marble, ſet upon ſockets of fine Gold, his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the Cedars, his mouth is moſt ſweet; yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of</hi> Jeruſalem.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place ſhe ſurveyeth his greatneſſe: his outward greatneſſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our apprehenſion, and expreſſion.</p>
               <p>As firſt the greatneſſe of his birth: where ſhe findeth that he is <hi>the Son of God,</hi> Lu. 1. 35. Not an adopted <hi>Son,</hi> or younger brother: But the <hi>onely begotten Son of God,</hi> 1 John 4. 9.</p>
               <pb n="254" facs="tcp:123675:134"/>
               <p> Secondly, the greatneſſe of his wealth, or eſtate. <hi>He is the Heir of all things,</hi> Heb. 1. 2. <hi>The earth is his, and the fulneſſe thereof, the world, and they that dwell therein,</hi> Pſal. 24. 1.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the greatneſſe of his power. Even the <hi>windes, and the Sea obey him,</hi> Mat. 8. 27. <hi>Yea, all power is given to him in Heaven, and in Earth,</hi> Mat. 28. 18.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the greatneſſe of his deſerts, or worthineſſe. <hi>Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, to receive power, and riches, and wiſdom, and ſtrength, and honour, and glorie, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,</hi> Rev. 5. 12.</p>
               <p>And fifthly, the greatneſſe of his Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: <hi>He is the bleſſed, and onely Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 15.</p>
               <p>In the third place, ſhe admireth his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſſential <hi>Graces.</hi> And firſt his <hi>Love,</hi> that he ſhould love her ſo: as to <hi>purchaſe her with his own bloud,</hi> Acts 20. 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>As to die for her,</hi> Rom. 5. 6. <hi>Even a curſed death,</hi> Gal. 3. 13.</p>
               <p>Next this, ſhe wondreth at his matchleſſe goodneſſe: the goodneſſe of his <hi>Love,</hi> or his goodneſſe in loving her, when ſhe deſerved no ſuch thing, as love: <hi>when no eye pitied her, to have compaſſion upon her, but ſhe was caſt out into the open field, to the loathing of her perſon,</hi> Ezek. 16. 5.</p>
               <pb n="255" facs="tcp:123675:134"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Then, even then, he paſſed by her, and looked upon her: and behold, her time was a time of Love, and he ſpread his ſhirt over her, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered her nakedneſſe, and ſware unto her, and entred into a Covenant with her, and made her his own. Then he waſhed her, and anointed her, he decked her with the richeſt Ornaments, both of Jewels, and Rayment: he fed her with the chief eſt nouriſhment: And her beauty was made perfect through his comelineſſe, that he had put upon her,</hi> Ezek. 16. 8. to the 15. <hi>verſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in conſideration of theſe ſo great, ſo undeſerved favours, ſhe crieth out with that good Prophet <hi>David. O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good; for his mercy endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for ever,</hi> Pſal. 107. 1.</p>
               <p>And ſo thirdly, ſhe falleth upon his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which ſhe cannot but mightily commend, for that ſo ſoon as ſhe became ſenſible of her own lamentable condition, he then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peard to her moſt mercifull. For no ſooner did ſhe finde her ſelf to be <hi>by nature the child of wrath,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. And by ſin the <hi>child of the Devil,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 8.</p>
               <p>But ſuddenly ſhe perceived, that <hi>he had redeemed her to God by his bloud,</hi> Rev. 5. 9.</p>
               <p>That <hi>when ſhe was yet his enemy, he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled her to God by his death, and moſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly ſaved her by his life,</hi> Rom. 5. 10.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:123675:135"/>
               <p> And all this without the leaſt ſatisfaction, by, or from her ſelf: <hi>For not by works of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe that ſhe had done, but according to his mercie he ſaved her,</hi> Tit. 3. 5.</p>
               <p>And ſhe is moſt confident that he will continue her, in her now happy eſtate: For he hath ſaid, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fake thee,</hi> Hebr. 13. 5.</p>
               <p>Neither can ſhe doubt, but what he hath ſaid, he will moſt certainly perform.</p>
               <p>For ſhe findeth Fourthly, That he is <hi>full of Grace, and Truth,</hi> John 1. 14.</p>
               <p>Yea he is the very <hi>Truth it ſelf,</hi> John 14. 6.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſhe ſings with <hi>David. Her</hi> Lord <hi>is good, his mercie is everlaſting and his truth endureth to all generations,</hi> Pſal. 100. 5.</p>
               <p>Nor Fifthly, is ſhe afrighted at his <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi> But rather ſhe rejoyceth therein.</p>
               <p>For albeit, <hi>The wages of ſin is death.</hi> Rom. 6. 23.</p>
               <p>And <hi>every tranſgreſſion, and every diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence muſt receive a juſt recompence of reward,</hi> As <hi>Hebr.</hi> 2. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet the law of the Spirit of life in her</hi> Lord Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>hath freed her from the law of ſin and of death,</hi> Rom. 8. 2.</p>
               <p>And in ſuch a caſe, it is not the office of Juſtice to condemn; but to acquit, protect, and juſtifie.</p>
               <pb n="257" facs="tcp:123675:135"/>
               <p> And ſixthly ſhe can never forget his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who is <hi>the wiſdom of</hi> God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24.</p>
               <p>She apprehendeth, by faith, that it was he, <hi>which made the earth by his power, which eſtabliſhed the world by his wiſdom, and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the heaven by his underſtanding,</hi> As <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He knoweth them that are his,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he knoweth, how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reſerve the unjuſt unto the day of judgement to be puniſhed,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 9.</p>
               <p>And ſhe doubteth not, but ſhe may moſt ſafely, and ſavingly reſign her ſelf to his direction, and diſpoſition: <hi>For in him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom, and knowledge,</hi> Coloſ. 2, 3.</p>
               <p>The ſoul that adds a thouſand fold to theſe, ſhall yet fall ſhort a thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand fold of his eſſentiall ſuper-excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and loſe her ſelf at laſt in admiration.</p>
               <p>Yet by theſe dear indearing contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhe acts, and ſtrengthens, and improves her <hi>Love;</hi> and works it to a proſperous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diton.</p>
               <p>For as the roote, by vertue of the Sap, cauſeth the tree to put forth fair green leaves.</p>
               <p>So worketh <hi>Faith</hi> by <hi>Love,</hi> and fits the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:123675:136"/> ſoul (the chaſt ſoul) for a flouriſhing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>ANd now (though ſomewhat baſhfull) yet ſhe dares diſcover her affections to her friends, the ſweet companions of her virgin <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I charge you, O daughters of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>if you finde my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am ſick of love.</hi> Saith ſhe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 8.</p>
               <p>And therefore as the virgin lover firſt delighteth much to meditate upon the rare perfections of her Paramore: So in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, ſhe will be talking of him very often, extolling and comending his perſon, parts, and properties: that ſo he may the better come to the knowledge, and aſſurance of her intire affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. In like manner, the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick ſoul, that panteth after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> will not omit the leaſt occaſion, or opportunity of conference concerning her dear <hi>Lord:</hi> but will evermore be magnifying his goodneſs, loving-kindneſs, and the like, and ſetting forth the promiſes due thereto.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Becauſe thy loving-kindneſs is better then life, therefore my lips ſhall praiſe thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 63. 3.</p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:123675:136"/>
               <p> And to that purpoſe, ſhe conſorts her ſelf, with his true ſervants, &amp; his truſtie friends: whom ſhe inviteth kindly to a ſweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moneous concord, and converſation. <hi>O come</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>let us ſing unto the</hi> Lord, <hi>let us make a joyfull noiſe to the rock of ovr ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let us come before his preſence with thankſgiving, and make a joyfull noiſe unto him with Pſalms, For the</hi> Lord <hi>is a great</hi> God, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94 <hi>to the</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>And from hence ſhe proceedeth to a more eminent, and evident Profeſſion of her true zeal, and pure integrity: which will appear the more infallibly, by loving that, which he is known to love, and hating that, which he abhors, and hates.</p>
               <p>Reſolved thus: She findes <hi>he loveth righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and hateth wickedneſſe,</hi> Pſal. 45. 7.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſhe directeth her affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of love, and hatred towards the ſame Objects.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place ſhe loveth righteouſneſs: whether it be the righteouſneſs of faith, which juſtifieth the perſon: or the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the law, which juſtifieth the faith of the perſon. For ſhe knoweth that as the one is the cauſe of her juſtification: ſo the other is the evidence of her ſanctification.</p>
               <p>And this her <hi>Love</hi> appeareth very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:123675:137"/> upon the account of theſe four pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is <hi>Cordiall,</hi> ſecondly, it is <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,</hi> thirdly, it is <hi>Confident,</hi> and fourthly, it is <hi>Comprehenſive.</hi> Firſt, (I ſay) it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall, It is no brain-ſick fancy begotten by imagination, brought forth by opinion, nurſed by ignorance, and maintained by impudence.</p>
               <p>Neither is it an outward formall profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, modalled by ſelf-ſeeking, and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by ſelf-conceit.</p>
               <p>Theſe are degenerate monſters, baſtard brats: abominable to her virgin breſt.</p>
               <p>She owns no other love, but what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the aſſurance of a ſaving faith, infuſed by the <hi>Spirit of her Lord</hi> into the hidden corners of her heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I ſleep</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>but my heart waketh</hi> Cant. 5. 2. her loving heart is evermore in labour. Neither can any thing prevent, or hinder her amourous deſires from running out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the righteouſneſs of her dear <hi>Lord</hi> Becauſe, <hi>He is the</hi> Lord <hi>her righteouſneſſe.</hi> Jer. 23. 6.</p>
               <p>Secondly, her love is conſtant: She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth not the face of the times, nor the courſe of the tide: the praiſe of a paraſite, nor the partling of a Parrat. Neither will
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:123675:137"/> ſhe take the ſpirit of giddineſs for her guide, leaſt by any means ſhe ſhould wax wanton againſt <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and wed her ſelf to ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy creature: like the younger widows, <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 11.</p>
               <p>Profits, Pleaſures, and preferments may haply wooe her, but cannot win her, to leave her <hi>firſt Love:</hi> For ſhe findes that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved that lightneſſe in the angel of the Church of <hi>Epheſus, Reve.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
               <p>She cannot do ſuch deſperate wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſin againſt her bleſſed <hi>Saviour:</hi> who hath betrothed her unto himſelf in righteouſneſs, and ratified his contract by the ſweet, and precious ingagements of his Goſpel.</p>
               <p>And therfore her <hi>Love</hi> is ſo deeply rooted in the center of her ſoul, that ſhe cannot <hi>be toſſed to and fro, and carried away with every wind of Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But being ſincere in love, ſhe groweth up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in all things, which is her head,</hi> verſ. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>My righteouſneſſe I hold faſt, and will not let it go: my heart ſhall not reproach me ſo long as I live,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> Job. 27. 6.</p>
               <p>This was a notable ſign, that he loved righteouſneſs with much conſtancy.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, her love to righteouſneſs is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident: It will not be daunted nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged.</p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:123675:138"/>
               <p> Though proud <hi>Haman</hi> deſpiſeth poor <hi>Mordecay,</hi> and projecteth the deſtruction of himſelf, and all his people. As <hi>Eſther</hi> 3. 6.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Mordecay</hi> will not give divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that ambitious upſtart, <hi>Eſter</hi> 5. 9.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Nebuchad-nezzar</hi> the mighty king of <hi>Babylon</hi> maketh an idolatrous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree: and threatneth a burning fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, to ſuch as ſhall be diſobedient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> the ſervants of the moſt high <hi>God;</hi> will not ſerve his gods, nor worſhip the golden image, that he hath ſet up, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Darius,</hi> by the policy of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidents, and councellers eſtabliſheth a roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all ſtatute: <hi>That whoſoever ſhall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty daies, ſave of the King himſelf, he ſhall be caſt into the den of lions,</hi> Dan. 6, 7. Yet <hi>Daniel</hi> (though he knows, that the writing is ſealed) will <hi>kneel upon his knees three times a day, and pray, and give thanks before his</hi> God, <hi>as he did aforetime,</hi> Dan. 6. 10. See here how confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent theſe godly men appeared in their love to righteouſneſs: And read yet further, how the <hi>Lord</hi> ſucceeded their confidence with ſtrange deliverances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Caſt not away therefore your confidence,</hi>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:123675:138"/> 
                  <hi>which hath great recompence of reward: for ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of</hi> God, <hi>ye might receive the promiſe: for yet a little while, and he that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry,</hi> Heb. 10. 35. 36. 27.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, her <hi>Love</hi> is very comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive: It comprehendeth, owneth, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth all righteouſneſs where ever it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideth.</p>
               <p>She is not hypocritically proud: ſo as to ſay: <hi>Stand by thy ſelf come not neer me, for I am holier then thou: like rebellions</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But in lowlineſs of minde, ſhe eſteemeth each other better then her ſelf.</hi> As, <hi>Phili.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Nor gainfully ſuperſtitious, to cry out <hi>Great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the</hi> Epheſians: with <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius,</hi> and his fellow craftſmen. As, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 34.</p>
               <p>But ſhe acknowledgeth, <hi>That godlineſſe is profitable unto all things.</hi> As, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
               <p>Nor is ſhe inſolently factious, <hi>To deſpiſe dominion, and ſpeak evil of dignities:</hi> with the Apoſtle <hi>Judes filthy dreamers.</hi> As, <hi>Jude</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>But ſhe endeavoureth, <hi>To keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> According to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> preſwaſion, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am a companion to all them, that fear</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:123675:139"/> 
                  <hi>thee.</hi> Saith good <hi>David</hi> unto his <hi>God,</hi> Pſal. 119. 63.</p>
               <p>To all them that fear thee, without any exception, or limination. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> commends the <hi>Epheſians:</hi> for their <hi>love to all the Saints,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 15.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay: 'tis very difficult, for us to know a ſinner from a ſaint, in times of tolleration: wherein profeſſion uſurps the forme, and undermines the power of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs. Thererore we ſhall do wiſely to conſider, what <hi>David</hi> ſaith concerning this particular. <hi>My Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>my good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe extendeth not to thee: but to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, in whom is all my delight,</hi> Pſal. 16. 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Or thus according to the vulgar reading. <hi>All my delight is upon the Saints: and upon ſuch as excell in virtue.</hi> A morall vertue ſhall not miſſe of a ſuteable reward, if it be cordiall; though it be conſtrained.</p>
               <p>This we may ſee in the example of <hi>Ahab,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But wo be unto you ye hypocrites,</hi> ſaith <hi>Chriſt</hi> eight times in one, and the ſame chapter, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe they that are truely godly, leſt they ſhould be or partial or prejuditious, in their love to righteouſneſſe: do not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to pray with our Apoſtle, that <hi>The</hi> Lord
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:123675:139"/> 
                  <hi>would make them to increaſe and abound in love one towards another, and towards all men.</hi> As in 1 <hi>Theſſa.</hi> 3. 12.</p>
               <p>And as the virgin ſoul doth thus profeſſe her fervent love unto her deareſt <hi>Lord:</hi> by loving righteouſneſſe, which he doth love: So on the other ſide ſhe doth expreſſe the like unfained <hi>Love</hi> by hating ſin, and wickedneſſe, becauſe he hateth it.</p>
               <p>But haply you will ſay, the very name of wickedneſſe is harſh and odious: Is there a man that hates not wickedneſſe?</p>
               <p>'Tis true indeed, 'tis hard to finde a man, ſo vile or graceleſſe, but that he would ſeem to be an enemy to wickedneſſe.</p>
               <p>But yet in practice there are very few, but do allow, commit, defend, or love it.</p>
               <p>And therefore, firſt let me demand this queſtion: when thou art ſet upon by any ſin, doſt thou reſiſt it by the power of <hi>faith?</hi> and fight againſt it under <hi>Gods</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? Canſt thou ſincerely ſay with god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Joſeph. How can I do this great wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and ſin againſt God,</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 9.</p>
               <p>This is a ſigne thou hateſt ſin indeed: Or doeſt thou otherwiſe refrain from ſin, for fear of ſhame, reproach, or puniſhment? Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thou haſt thy reward. But this is fear proceeding from ſelf-love: No love to <hi>God,</hi> no hatred againſt ſin.</p>
               <pb n="266" facs="tcp:123675:140"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Ye that love the Lord hate evil,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97. 10. And therefore ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let us conſider the nature, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of <hi>hatred.</hi> This hatred is no giddy frantick paſſion; but a mature deliberate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Such a notorious oppoſite to <hi>Love,</hi> that they can never be ſo reconciled, as to imbrace, or favour the ſame object: They are agreed ever to diſagree. Yet they are Twins, both ſtrugling in one wombe, not to be parted, not to be atoned, conſent begets, and emnity preſerves them: For hatred lives by love, love thrives by hatred: Love firſt gives hatred an occaſion, and hatred proſecutes loves adverſaries. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whoſoever loveth <hi>God,</hi> muſt hate all ſin as grievous unto <hi>God. Thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins: thou haſt wearied me with thine iniquities,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord</hi> to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Iſa. 43. 24.</p>
               <p>Now we muſt know, that many men do much miſtake themſelves in this particular. A man may be inraged againſt ſin: and yet not hate it: Yea, he may proteſt, and vow againſt it very ſeriouſly, and yet not hate it really and rightly. And therefore we may do well to conſider, that hatred, which is perfect and compleat, hath theſe three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties.</p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:123675:140"/>
               <p> Firſt, it is <hi>impartial:</hi> Secondly, it is <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous:</hi> And thirdly, it is <hi>implacable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, if it deſerveth the right name of hatred, it is impartial. And therefore he that truely hateth ſin: he doth hate all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſin, and in all manner of perſons.</p>
               <p>He muſt hate all manner of ſin: He may not hate riotouſneſſe, and love covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: hate ſwearing, and love lying; hate publick prophaneſſe, and love private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſneſſe, or the contrary. <hi>I hate every falſe way,</hi> ſaith good <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119. 128.</p>
               <p>And to that purpoſe he prayeth unto his <hi>God:</hi> ſaying, <hi>Incline not my heart to any evil thing,</hi> Pſal. 41. 4. Doubtleſſe, 'tis hard to finde a man, whoſe heart is not inclin'd to many evil things: But wher's that Soul a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, that is not ſo wedded unto ſome bewitching luſt, ſome <hi>Dalila;</hi> one boſom ſin or other, of which we are inclineable to ſay, as <hi>Lot</hi> did ſometime ſay concerning <hi>Zoar: Is it not a little one?</hi> Gen. 19. 20.</p>
               <p>Yet every <hi>ſin is a tranſgreſſion of the Law,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 4.</p>
               <p>And <hi>curſed is every one, that continueth not in all things, which are written in the book of the Law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prophet <hi>David. Search me (O God</hi> ſaith he) <hi>and know my heart: try me, and</hi>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:123675:141"/> 
                  <hi>know my thoughts. And ſee if there be any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked way in me, and lead me in the way ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting,</hi> Pſal. 139. 23, 24.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul: Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſſe in the fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe St. <hi>Jude</hi> exhorteth: <hi>To hate even the Garment ſpotted by the fleſh,</hi> Jude 23.</p>
               <p>Alluding haply to thoſe forbidden things of the Law: whereby their very Garments were defiled: And intimating to us under the Goſpel: <hi>That we ought to abſtain, even from all appearance of evil,</hi> according to that of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. 22.</p>
               <p>And as we muſt hate ſin in general, ſo we muſt hate all ſinne in every perſon. A man would think, there had been no great cauſe of offence for <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> to aſſiſt <hi>Ahab</hi> in the recovery of <hi>Ramoth Gilead.</hi> They were both of the ſtock of <hi>Abraham,</hi> joyned in affinity, profeſſed the ſame Religion, the cauſe was juſt, and the enemy an idolatrous Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, <hi>Jehu</hi> the Seer ſaid unto <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> the King: <hi>Shouldeſt thou help the ungodly, and love them, that hate the Lord? Therefore is wrath upon thee from before the Lord,</hi> 2 Chron. 19. 2. And are there not too
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:123675:141"/> many amongſt us, that do profeſſe much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation againſt the miſcarriages of ſuch, as are either averſe, or unprofitable to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns: whereas a little affinity, or friendſhip, or faction, or the like carnal complyance will eaſily over-rule us to approve, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronize, the moſt abomi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>able actions?</p>
               <p>Like wicked <hi>Ahab,</hi> who hated the ſaving truth in the mouth of <hi>Micaiah,</hi> becauſe it was contrary to his intention, and imbraced a pernitious lye from the mouths of his falſe Prophets; becauſe it was agreeable to his preſent reſolution: as in the 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>Yea, ſuch is the damnable deceitfulneſſe of ſelf-love, that many of us are thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched to cenſure thoſe ſins moſt ſeverely in others, which we our ſelves are ten times more notoriouſly guilty of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And thinkeſt thou this, O man, that judgeſt them, which do ſuch things, and doſt the ſame, that thou ſhalt eſcape the judgement of God?</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 2. 3.</p>
               <p>Verily this carnal ſelf-love muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity be turned into ſpiritual ſelf-hatred, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther temporal, or eternal. <hi>For we are ſure that the judgement of God is according to truth againſt them, which commit ſuch things,</hi> as ſaith the ſame <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Rom. 2. 2.</p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:123675:142"/>
               <p> Nothing is ſo offenſive unto <hi>God,</hi> or ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to our ſelves as ſin: The peſtilence in our bloud, the poyſon in our bowels, and the ſword in our ſides, all theſe together can but kill the body, according to a temporary death: But ſin is of ſo deſperate a ſtrain, that it deſtroyes both ſoul and body too, and hurries them into eternal torments.</p>
               <p>And therefore he that hateth not all ſin, and in all perſons, chiefly in himſelf, his ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hatred is Hypocriſie, and his love to <hi>God,</hi> and his own Soul is nothing bettter. Therefore <hi>be not deceived, God is not mocked,</hi> Gal. 6. 7.</p>
               <p>Secondly, hatred, if 'tis true: and perfect: it is impetuous, or violent, nothing will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie it but the death, or the deſtruction of every thing, whereon it reſteth. We finde that <hi>Eſau</hi> hated his brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> becauſe of the bleſſing, wherewith his father had bleſſed him. <hi>And</hi> Eſau <hi>ſaid in his heart, the dayes of mourning for my father are at hand, then will I ſlay my brother</hi> Jacob, <hi>Geneſ.</hi> 27. 41.</p>
               <p>And doubtleſſe he had done, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: had not the <hi>Lord</hi> his <hi>God</hi> preſerved <hi>Jacob,</hi> according to his power, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. 11.</p>
               <p>We likewiſe finde, how that the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> did hate their brother <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Gen. 37. 4.</p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:123675:142"/>
               <p> And they conſulted together to ſlay him, <hi>verſe</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>And if we deal more kindly by our ſins, it is a ſign, we are but angry with them, we do not hate them with a perfect hatred, like that of <hi>David,</hi> wherewith he did hate, the haters of his <hi>God. Do not I hate them, O Lord,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that hate thee? And am I not grieved with thoſe that riſe up againſt thee? I hate them with a perfect hatred,</hi> Pſal. 139. 21, 22.</p>
               <p>There are two great evils, in, and belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto every ſin: to wit, the evil of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. 5. And the evil of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 39. Whereof the firſt is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential, and offenſive to the ſpirit: the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is accidental, and offenſive to the fleſh. And from hence it proceedeth, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual man hateth ſin, for the iniquity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: In reference to <hi>God.</hi> But the carnal man is angry with ſin, onely becauſe of the puniſhment thereof, in relation to himſelf. <hi>God is not in all his thoughts,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 10. 4.</p>
               <p>And therefore, becauſe he hateth not the iniquity, which he ought to hate: the puniſhment which he hateth, ſhall fall upon him, unto his confuſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 13. Whileſt he, which hateth that, which <hi>God</hi> doth
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:123675:143"/> hate: ſhall ſurely be approved of by <hi>God,</hi> Rev. 2. 6.</p>
               <p>And therefore it will be of ſpecial uſe unto us, to conſider, with what vehemency, the Prophet <hi>David</hi> endeavoureth to aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the violence, or the ſeverity of his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred againſt ſin, and ſinners, in his 101. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> Wherein he maketh divers proteſtations, or promiſes unto this very purpoſe: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will ſee no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aſide, it ſhall not cleave to me,</hi> verſe 3. A <hi>froward heart ſhall depart from me: I will not know a wicked perſon,</hi> verſe 4. <hi>Who ſo privily ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look, and a proud heart will not I ſuffer,</hi> verſe 5. <hi>He that worketh deceit, ſhall not dwell within my h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uſe: he that telleth lies, ſhall not tarry in my ſight,</hi> verſe 7. <hi>I will early deſtroy all the wicked of the land: that I may cut off all wicked doers from the citie of the Lord,</hi> verſe 8.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>David</hi> as a King, and thus do thou, according to thy power, or do not ſay; that thou haſt any hatred againſt ſin.</p>
               <p>And as that hatred which is warrantable, is both impartial, and impetuous: So in the third place 'tis implacable, never to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed, or reconciled.</p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:123675:143"/>
               <p> This is not hatred, to fall out with ſin, or quarrel with it, at ſome ſpecial time, or for ſome extraordinary cauſe. For thus the moſt ungracious Reprobate may ſometimes hate his beſt-beloved ſin: And yet <hi>return with the Dogge to his vomit, and the Sow, that was waſhed, to her wallowing in the mire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If thus the unclean ſpirit goeth out of a man, it is but onely to recruit his forces: he will return, and take unto himſelf ſeven o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpirits, more wicked then himſelf, and they will enter in, and dwell there: and the laſt ſtate of that man is worſe then the firſt. According to that ſaying of our <hi>Saviour, Luke</hi> 11. 26. But when a man in expectation of <hi>Gods</hi> eternal <hi>Love</hi> by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his love to <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> the violence and perpetuity of his impartial hatred will be ſuch againſt all ſin, and every tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: That he will chuſe to ſuffer the affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> Pſal. 105. 17, 18. Much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then he will be reconciled to any ſin, or become ſerviceable unto the Prince of darkneſſe: though with <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> he be ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereto day by day, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 10.</p>
               <p>And thus the Soul that is in love with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> declares it by her Chriſtian profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: eſpecially. In loving righteouſneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loves it, and hating wickedneſſe,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:123675:144"/> becauſe he hates it. And having thus throughly endeer'd herſelf, by manifeſting her affections: and fixing them upon their proper objects.</p>
               <p>In the next place ſhe doth prepare her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to ſeek and entertain her princely lover.</p>
               <p>For as the <hi>Tree</hi> that is planted in a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoyl, doth not onely increaſe her <hi>ſap</hi> in her ſelf, and ſend it forth in flouriſhing green leaves: but likewiſe by the vertue of that <hi>ſap</hi> ſhe putteth forth her beautifull fair <hi>bloſſoms,</hi> whereby we are induced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that ſhe will bring forth fruit accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p>Even ſo the Soul, that by a lively <hi>faith,</hi> is planted into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> doth not onely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove her love by <hi>Contemplation,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt it by <hi>Profeſſion:</hi> But likewiſe ſhe moſt earneſtly endeavoureth to fit, and confirm it by <hi>Preparation.</hi>

               <p>It is a principal part of <hi>Iehoſhaphats</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations: That <hi>he prepared his heart to ſeek God,</hi> 2 Chron. 19. 3.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> one of his ſucceſſours,

               <p>
                  <hi>And the Lord hearkened to</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>and healed the people,</hi> verſe 20.</p>
               <p>And in this ſearch the loving Soul conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth, <hi>when, where,</hi> and <hi>how</hi> ſhe may ſo ſeek her <hi>Lord:</hi> that ſhe may <hi>ſoon, ſafely,</hi> and <hi>ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> finde him: And to that purpoſe ſhe doth call to minde, that the holy <hi>Ghoſt</hi> ſets forth a threefold preſcription in order to the time, when ſhe's to ſeek him. Firſt, <hi>early,</hi> Prov. 8. 17.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>continually,</hi> Chron. 16. 11.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, <hi>evermore,</hi> Pſal. 105. 4. <hi>Early</hi> in regard of <hi>opportunity: Continually</hi> in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>conſtancie:</hi> And <hi>evermore</hi> in relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to <hi>perpetuity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, early without delaying. In the morning of her youth: <hi>Remember thy Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour in the dayes of thy youth,</hi> ſaith that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Preacher, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 1.</p>
               <p>And thus good <hi>Obadiah</hi> to <hi>Elijah: I thy ſervant fear the Lord from my youth,</hi> 1 Tim. 18. 12.</p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:123675:145"/>
               <p> Secondly, continually without wavering: <hi>For he that wavereth is like a wave of the Sea, driven with the winde, and toſſed: Let not that man think, that he ſhall receive any thing of the Lord,</hi> James 1. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, evermore without revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or apoſtatizing: <hi>He that endureth to the end ſhall be ſaved,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Son of God,</hi> Mat. 10. 22.</p>
               <p>It is regiſtred of <hi>Aſa,</hi> That he did that, which was good and right in the eyes of the <hi>Lord</hi> his <hi>God,</hi> 2 Chron. 14. 2.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, it is a notable blemiſh to his integrity, that towards his latter end: <hi>In his diſeaſe he ſought not to the Lord, but to the Phyſicians,</hi> 2 Chr. 16. 12.</p>
               <p>And thus the love-ſick Soul will ſeek her <hi>Lord</hi> early, leaſt having withdrawn himſelf: <hi>ſhe ſeek him but cannot finde him, and call him, but he gives her no anſwer,</hi> as <hi>Cant.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
               <p>She will ſeek him continually, <hi>leaſt he cometh in a day, when ſhe looketh not for him, and in an hour that ſhe is not ware of,</hi> Mat. 24. 50.</p>

               <p>And in the ſecond place ſhe doth conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:123675:145"/> where ſhe may ſafely ſeek for her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved. And is reſolved that this muſt be in his Ordinances; and eſpecially in his word: which is ſometimes called the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he himſelf hath taught her: ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Search the Scriptures, for they are they, which teſtifie of me,</hi> John 5. 39.</p>
               <p>And therefore the Prophet <hi>David</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth unto the <hi>Lord: That he rejoyceth at his word, as one that findeth great ſpoiles,</hi> Pſal. 119. 162.</p>
               <p>And the faithfull ſpouſe in the <hi>Canticles</hi> deſireth to hear the voice of her dear <hi>Lord</hi> ſaying, <hi>Thou that dwelleſt in the gardens, the companions hearken unto thy voice: cauſe me to hear it</hi> Cant. 8. 13.</p>
               <p>But I conceive it may be Objected, That we may hear ſeverall voices ſpeaking in the holy Scriptures: and therefore how ſhall we know the voice of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> from other voices? I anſwer, it is true indeed, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture do diſcover unto us ſeverall voices: eſpecially the voice of <hi>God</hi> in his law, and the voice <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or of <hi>God in Chriſt,</hi> in his Goſpel. And they are ſo frequently, and ſo diverſly mixed or intermingled the one with the other, according to the wonderfull wiſdom of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and that both in the old and new <hi>Teſtaments:</hi> that it requireth
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:123675:146"/> a good and a willing underſtanding, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh rightly between them.</p>
               <p>For all that is contained in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, although we do generally call that the Goſpell, is not to be underſtood as the voice of the Goſpel, or the voice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> according to his Goſpel, <hi>Every idle word that men ſhall ſpeak, they ſhall give account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in the day of judgement.</hi> There is the voice of the law in the midſt of the Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 36. Neither may we think, that whatſoever is found in the old Teſtament, which is commonly called the law, is to be referred to the voice of the law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the Scripture foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the Heathen by faith, preached the Goſpell before unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8.</p>
               <p>Saying, <hi>In thee ſhall all nations be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 12. 3.</p>
               <p>And the like we finde many: very many times both in the old and new Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Neither are theſe ſeverall voices divided ſeverally into certain Books, or Pages, or Chapters, ſeeing we do ſomtimes meet with them both in one and the ſame verſe. <hi>The wages of ſin is death:</hi> there is the voice of the law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the gift of God is eternall life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> There is the voice
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:123675:146"/> of the Goſpel in the ſame <hi>verſe.</hi> The like may be obſerved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 22. And in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other places, wherefore that we may arive at a right underſtanding in theſe ſo neceſſary differences or diſtinctions: we will firſt lay down two generall rules, and afterwards proceed to more particular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, when we finde any work injoyned to be done, or the contrary commanded not to be done, under any penalty, either temporall or eternall: whether it be curſe, or captivity, famine, or peſtilence: deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, death, or damnation: or any promiſe made upon doing, or not doing. This we muſt underſtand to be the voice of <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, whereſoever the ſubject mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is of <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his kingdom: or the promiſe of grace, or the condition <hi>faith:</hi> and the reward either ſpirituall in its own nature, or ſpirituallized by grace. This we may be ſure, is the voice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his <hi>Goſpell.</hi> Theſe we ſhall finde to be the two generall Rules, From whence we will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct theſe following particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, the voice of <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>Law,</hi> is a voice of command. <hi>Theſe words, which I command thee this day ſhall be in thine heart,</hi> Deut. 6, 6.</p>
               <pb n="276" facs="tcp:123675:147"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>This thing commanded I them ſaying, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey my voice, and I will be your</hi> God, <hi>and ye ſhall be my people,</hi> Jer. 7. 23.</p>
               <p>But the voice of the Goſpel is a voice of intreaty. <hi>As though</hi> God <hi>did beſeech you by us, we pray you in</hi> Chriſt <hi>ſtead; be ye recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 20.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the voice of the law is a voice of compulſion. <hi>If his Children forſake my law and walk not in my judgements, If they break my ſtatutes, and keep not my commandments: Then will I viſit their tranſgreſſion with the rod: and their iniquitie with ſtripes,</hi> Pſal. 89. 30, 31, 32.</p>
               <p>But the voice of the Goſpel, is a voice of attraction, or invitation. <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting love: therefore with loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindeneſſe have I drawn thee,</hi> Jer. 31. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are beavie laden, and I will give you reſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And <hi>him that cometh unto me, I will in no wiſe caſt out, ſaith</hi> the <hi>Son of God,</hi> Jo. 6. 37.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the voice of the law, is a voice of bondage, <hi>curſed is every one that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in all thing, which are written in the book of the law to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. 10.</p>
               <p>But the voice of the Goſpel, is a voice of liberty. <hi>The Spirit of the</hi> Lord God <hi>is upon</hi>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:123675:147"/> 
                  <hi>me, becauſe the</hi> Lord <hi>hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek: he hath ſent me to binde up the broken hearted: to proclaim libertie to the captives, and the opening of the priſon to them that are bound,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. 1. &amp;c. <hi>Stand faſt therefore in the liberty, wherewith</hi> Chriſt <hi>hath made us free,</hi> Gala. 5. 1. <hi>for if the Son ſhall make you free: ye ſhall be free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> John 8. 36.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the voice of the law, is a voice of enmity. <hi>Ye adulterers and adultereſſes, know ye not, that the friendſhip of the world is enmity with</hi> God? <hi>whoſoever therefore will be a friend to the world, is the enemy of God,</hi> James 4. 4. And <hi>God ſhall wound the head of his enemies,</hi> Pſal. 68. 21.</p>
               <p>But the voice of the Goſpel is a voice of reconciliation, <hi>when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his Sons</hi> Rom. 5. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And God was in</hi> Chriſt <hi>reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 19.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, the voice of the law, is a voice of wrath. <hi>The law worketh wrath,</hi> Rom. 4. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For by it, the wrath of God is revealed from heaven againſt all ungodlineſſe, and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of men.</hi> As, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
               <p>But the voice of the Goſpel, is a voice of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:123675:148"/> love. <hi>God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners,</hi> Chriſt <hi>died for us,</hi> Rum. 5. 8. And therefore, the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick ſoul in the Canticles. <hi>It is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, ſaying, Open to me, my ſiſter, my love, My dove, my undefiled,</hi> Cant. 5. 2.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, the voice of the law is a voice of terrour, <hi>I heard thy voice in the garden, and was afraid,</hi> So <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> Gen. 3. 10. And when the <hi>Lord</hi> gave the law unto the <hi>Iſraelites. There were thunders, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet, exceeding loud, ſo that all the people that was in the camp, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi> Exod. 19. 16.</p>
               <p>And this did fore-ſhew the effects of the law to all ſuch as are under the law, for ever.</p>
               <p>But the voice of the Goſpel, is a voice of comfort. <hi>The Lord ſhall comfort</hi> Zion, <hi>he will comfort all her waſt places,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51. 3.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn: for they ſhall be comforted.</hi> Saith the <hi>Son of God,</hi> Mat. 5. 4.</p>
               <p>Seaventhly the voice of the law is, a voice of conviction. <hi>By the law is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of ſin,</hi> Rom. 3. 20. <hi>For I had not known ſin, but by the law,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. 7.</p>
               <pb n="279" facs="tcp:123675:148"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>And ſin by the commandment is become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſinfull,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, Rom. 7. 13.</p>
               <p>But the voice of the Goſpel, is a voice of Appeal. For <hi>the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement unto the Son,</hi> John 5. 22. <hi>And he is not an high prieſt, which cannot be touched with the feeling of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities: but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without ſin: let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and finde grace to help in time of need,</hi> ſaith the Apoſt. <hi>He.</hi> 4. 15, 16.</p>
               <p>Eightly, the voice of <hi>God</hi> in his law, is a voice of condemnation. <hi>The ſoul that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, it ſhall die.</hi> Saith the Lord, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And caſt ye the unprofitable ſervant into utter darkneſſe,</hi> Mat. 25. 30.</p>
               <p>But the voice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Goſpel, is a voice of pardon, <hi>verily, verily</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſay unto you, he that heareth my word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, and ſhall not come into condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but is paſſed from death to life,</hi> John 5. 14.</p>
               <p>And this pardon hath three degrees.</p>
               <p>Firſt, a <hi>Reprive:</hi> Secondly, an <hi>Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:</hi> And Thirdly, a <hi>Satisfaction.</hi> The firſt (I ſay) is a Reprive. And this hath been generall to all mankinde ſince the fall of
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:123675:149"/> 
                  <hi>Adam.</hi> He was the firſt that received the benefit thereof. And meerly by vertue of the ſaid Reprive, both he and all of his poſterity, have, do, and ſhall injoy their naturall lives: ſome ſhorter, and ſome longer: according to the bleſſed will and pleaſure of <hi>Chriſt our Lord</hi> and onely <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour. I have the Keyes of hell, and of death</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Reve.</hi> 1. 18. Whereby it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that there is no paſſage that way, but when, and by whom he pleaſeth to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point it. This I conceive to be the firſt degree, in order to this free, and gracious pardon. The ſecond is our <hi>Saviours</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion: <hi>He made interceſſion for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſours,</hi> Iſa. 53. 12. And <hi>he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them,</hi> Heb. 7. 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third, and higheſt is his ſatisfaction. He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions: he was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him: and with his ſtripes we are healed,</hi> Iſa. 53. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His ownſelf bare our ſins in his own body on the tree,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 24.</p>
               <p>Now if we ſhall in time of this reprive, lay hold, and reſt upon his Interceſſion, by an effectuall embracing faith: then we are certain that we ſhall injoy the benefit of his full ſatisfaction. And ſo we may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:123675:149"/> confident that this our pardon is both ſigned and ſealed. Due ſatisfaction is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged: <hi>Gods</hi> juſtice is compleatly vindicated; his indignation throughly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified: And what can hinder us from being ſaved? For <hi>it is God that juſtifieth, who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us,</hi> Rom. 8. 33, 34. But, if through all the time of our reprive, we ſhall reject, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh, or neglect ſo great ſalvation, as is offered in this interceſſion and ſatisfaction: Then, as the voice of <hi>God</hi> in his law hath paſſed upon us the ſentence of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: So the voice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Goſpel ſhall paſſe upon us the ſentence of executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>For he that believeth not ſhall be damned:</hi> This is part of that Goſpel which the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> commanded his Apoſtles to preach unto every creature, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16.</p>
               <p>The Scriptures mention other voices al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: As of <hi>Prophets that propheſie lies,</hi> Jer. 23. 25. Of thoſe <hi>that ſpeak perverſe things; to draw Diſciples after them.</hi> Acts 20. 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That by good words, and fair ſpeeches de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the hearts of the ſimple,</hi> Rom. 16. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſpeaks lies in hypocriſie,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſpeaks evill of dignities,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 10.</p>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:123675:150"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>That ſpeake evill of the things they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not,</hi> 2 Peter 2. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſpeak great ſwelling words of vanity,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That ſpeak great things, and blaſphemies,</hi> Rev. 13. 5.</p>
               <p>Theſe voices are remembered in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures: but they are all condemned by the Scriptures. And theſe, with every other of like nature, may be referred to the voice of <hi>Strangers,</hi> John 10. 5.</p>
               <p>Which (though they be extolled and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded, by giddy multitudes of brain-ſick beaſts of old ordained to this condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Jude</hi> 4.)</p>
               <p>This conſtant <hi>Lamb</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> will by no means, incline to hear or liſten after them: Leaſt they ſhould drive her into mire and dirt. As, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 20. Or draw her from her <hi>Shepheards</hi> tender boſom. As, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 11.</p>
               <p>Such were <hi>the watchmen, that did ſmite and wound the ſearching ſoul: The keepers of the walls that rifled her, and took away her vail,</hi> Cant. 5. 7.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſhe avoids them, day and night: their publick muſters, and their private meetings. As ſwarms of hurtfull locuſts, that proceed out of the ſmoak of hells infernall furnace.</p>
               <pb n="283" facs="tcp:123675:150"/>
               <p> As to the ſacred voice of <hi>God</hi> in his law: ſhe doth believe it, as it is the voice of ſuch an <hi>Authour,</hi> Exod. 20. 1. She learned it as a Rule to guide her goings, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 16. She loves it, as an argument of <hi>Love,</hi> John 14, 15.</p>
               <p>But looks upon it as a cancelled ſcroul; a dead caracter, in relation to any Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or ingagement, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
               <p>And ſo ſhe leaves it, with much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, And liſtens to her <hi>Lords</hi> voice in his Goſpel, <hi>Jo.</hi> 7. 37.</p>
               <p>And being thus inſtructed <hi>when</hi> and <hi>where,</hi> ſhe is to ſeek for her beloved <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the third place, ſhe ſets her ſelf to learn <hi>How</hi> ſhe may ſeek him ſo, as that ſhe may be ſure to finde him. And to that intent: <hi>She goeth her way forth by the foot-ſteps of the flock, and feedeth her Kids beſides the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds tents.</hi> According to her <hi>Lords</hi> directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
               <p>She walketh in the pathes of <hi>Chriſts</hi> own ſheep, to feed, and fill her ears with his pure doctrine, delivered by his faithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>
               <p>As for her mortall enemies, the <hi>Divell,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and <hi>Fleſh,</hi> that labour to betray, and intercept her, in her heavenly ſearch: with theſe ſhe holdeth a continuall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
               <pb n="284" facs="tcp:123675:151"/>
               <p> As for example, when the Divel meets her, in her delightfull way unto the <hi>word:</hi> And would divert her by his lewd ſuggeſtions, as that ſhe ſhall be rebuked, and reproved for her ſins, and threatned with miſery, death and deſtruction for her tranſgreſſions againſt the law of <hi>God:</hi> with ſuch like ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours not to be indured.</p>
               <p>She telleth him, <hi>that ſhe hath been already at mount</hi> Sinay, <hi>that might not be touched, and that burned with fire, and with blackneſs, and darkneſſe, and tempeſts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 18.</p>
               <p>But now the law, like a good Schole-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, leading her from thence, unto mount <hi>Sion,</hi> and <hi>unto the city of the living God: the heavenly Jeruſalem, and to an innumerable company of angels: to the generall aſſembly, and Church of the firſt born, which are written in heaven: and to God the judge of all, and to the Spirits of juſt men made perfect, and to Jeſus the mediatour of the new covenant,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore, with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>David: She will hear what God the Lord will ſpeak, for he will ſpeak peace unto his people, and to his Saints,</hi> Pſal. 85. 8.</p>
               <p>When, by his black mouth'd execrable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, the ſhame, and bane of Church, and Common-Wealth, the Devil doth revile the Miniſters of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> with baſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachfull
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:123675:151"/> titles: of purpoſe to blow up the zealous blaze of his own ſmoaking fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands: and to darken or quench the pure light of the glorious Goſpel. That ſo ſhe may not be able to ſee, when the <hi>Sun of righteouſneſſe ſhall ariſe with healing in his wings.</hi> As, <hi>Mala.</hi> 4. 2. The good ſoul onely renders him that anſwer, wherewith the angels of the <hi>Lord</hi> reproved him long ſince upon the very like occaſion. <hi>The Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke thee, O Satan,</hi> Zech. 3. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>And when that ſubtile ſerpent (now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, that all his helliſh engines cannot hinder the ſoul from liſtening to the word of <hi>God)</hi> endeavoureth by all means poſſible, to ſteal it from her, leaſt it ſhould prove fruitfull: She tells him plainly that ſhe will both <hi>hear the word of God and keep it,</hi> for ſo ſhe ſhall be certain of a bleſſing, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 28.</p>
               <p>Next, when the world would win her from the <hi>word,</hi> by his moſt ſpecious invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of pleaſures, profits, or preferments.</p>
               <p>She anſwers, <hi>That to live in pleaſures on the earth, is to nouriſh her ſelf, as in a day of ſlaughter,</hi> James 5. 5. But the <hi>word</hi> will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect her to the <hi>Lord</hi> her <hi>God: In whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence is fulneſſe of joy, and at whoſe right hand are pleaſures for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 16. 11.</p>
               <p>As for profit: although it be a leſſon,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:123675:152"/> that ſhe could gladly learn: yet ſhe will take it onely at <hi>Gods</hi> teaching. <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which teacheth thee to profit,</hi> ſaith her beloved, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. 17. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: <hi>what is a man profited, if he ſhal gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul,</hi> Mat. 16. 26.</p>
               <p>And for worldly preferments: experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tells her they are little worth. But the <hi>word</hi> teacheth her by the mouth of her own <hi>Lord. That whoſoever ſhall do the will of his Father, which is in heaven; the ſame is his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſiſter, and mother,</hi> Ma. 12. 50.</p>
               <p>And theſe are ſuch perpetuall preferm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents as all the world cannot preſent her with.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, when the dull fleſh would detain her from her attendance on the holy <hi>word:</hi> perſwading her that ſhe may ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſtill, and take her reſt awile; 'tis yet two early by an hour or two: and that the weather is foul, and wet, and cold, with the like flatteries and indulgencies.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe ſhe ſtarteth up, and ſaith: my beloved ſpeaks, and ſays unto me: <hi>Riſe up, my love, my fair one, and come away: for lo, the winter is paſt, the rain is over, and gone.</hi> As, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 10, 11. Or be it ne'r ſo rainy, cold, or foul, or full of lets and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies: yet neither ſhall the fleſh, the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:123675:152"/> World, nor Divel prevent her from the ſearch of her beloved: till with that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, ſhe can ſafely ſay: <hi>with my whole heart have I ſought thee,</hi> Pſal. 119. 10.</p>
               <p>And thus ſhe is reſolved when, and where, and <hi>How,</hi> ſhe is to ſeek her ſaving <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſeeing there are now ſuch multitudes that cry up <hi>Chriſt: lo here, lo there is Chriſt:</hi> and yet our <hi>Saviour</hi> ſaith: <hi>believe it not,</hi> Mat 24. 23. How ſhall the longing ſoul be ſure to know, when ſhe hath found the <hi>Chriſt</hi> her <hi>Lord</hi> indeed.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to this much materiall queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: She muſt conſider, that this <hi>Lord of glory,</hi> is alwayes guarded by a glorious train of gifts, and graces infinite for number: with which he enters into every ſoul; that is thus qualified, and prepared: But leaſt my taske ſhould be as infinite: I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe but onely ſix of them. As namely, <hi>Life, Light, Humility, Aſſurance, Peace:</hi> and <hi>Joy.</hi> Theſe alwayes are at hand, if not in ſight, to give attendance to this royall <hi>Bridegroom:</hi> And to confirm the <hi>Soul</hi> in this her ſearch.</p>

                  <hi>FIrſt, where this Prince of life is, there is life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that hath the Son hath life: and he that hath not the Son, hath not life,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John</hi> 1 John 5. 12.</p>
               <p>And this <hi>life</hi> is evidenced by theſe four particulars: namely, <hi>Senſe, Motion, Reſolution,</hi> and <hi>Action.</hi> The firſt thing that appeareth in this ſpiritual life is <hi>Senſe;</hi> whileſt we want this life of <hi>Chriſt</hi> we are altogether ſenſeleſſe: no better then dead, dead in treſpaſſes and ſins. Verily as the body without the <hi>Soul</hi> is dead: ſo the ſoul without <hi>Chriſt</hi> is dead alſo. She is alienated from the life of <hi>God,</hi> and being alienated from the life of <hi>God,</hi> ſhe is paſt feeling ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14. Ye ſhe is altogether ignorant of her own wretched condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>She knows not that ſhe is wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blinde and naked.</hi> As, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 17. But when <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is her <hi>life</hi> appeareth unto her, he reviveth, and quickeneth her. <hi>For as the father raiſeth up the dead, and quickeneth them: even ſo the Son doth quicken whom he will,</hi> John 5. 21.</p>
               <pb n="289" facs="tcp:123675:153"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>And you hath he quickened, who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> Epheſ. 2. 1.</p>
               <p>He gives the ſoul the feeling of her ſins, the ſight of Gods fierce wrath and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: and fearfull judgements thereupon depending. And being thus made truely ſenſibe of her own miſeries; immediately ſhe doth begin to ſtir, and move her ſelf towards the conſideration of her preſent dangerous condition, and the moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means for her recocery.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> when they were pricked in their hearts, at the relation of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer impieties: <hi>they ſaid unto Peter,</hi> And to the reſt of the Apoſtles. <hi>Men and brethren what ſhall we do?</hi> Acts 2. 37.</p>
               <p>And thus the regenerate <hi>Jaylour,</hi> being awaked by the power of <hi>God</hi> in that great earth-quake: feeling the foundations of the priſon ſhaken: ſeeing all the doors opened, and the priſoners bands looſed: and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, notwithſtanding all this; that none of them were eſcaped: immediately he called for a light, and ſprang in, and came trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and fell down before <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and brought them out and ſaid, <hi>Sirs what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi> Acts 16. 26, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor will this motion admit of reſt, until it putteth on a reſolution.</p>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:123675:154"/>
               <p> No ſooner is the ſoul thus throughly troubled, or moved with the ſenſe of her own miſeries, but ſhe will carefully reſolve upon ſome way or other to work her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe.</p>
               <p>And in like manner this her reſolution, if it be firm and conſtant, will endeavour to put it ſelf into ſome ſuddain action.</p>
               <p>All theſe four ſigns, degrees, or paſſages of a ſpiritual life do well appear, in that ſtory of thoſe four lepers, that ſate at the gate of <hi>Samaria</hi> in the time of the famine, <hi>the</hi> 2 <hi>of</hi> Kings <hi>the</hi> 7. <hi>beginning at the</hi> 3 verſe.</p>
               <p>For albeit their parly, and proceedings were meerly rationall, yet they may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed unto this our ſpiritual purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it appeareth that they became ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their preſent diſtreſſe, for they ſaid one to another: <hi>Why ſit we hear untill we die?</hi> Secondly their thoughts were moved, and ſtirred to work their deliverance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If we ſay, we will enter into the city</hi> (ſay they) <hi>then the famine is in the city, and we ſhall die there, and if we ſit ſtill here, we die alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, they took up a Reſolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now therefore come, and let us fall unto the hoſt of the Syrians: if they ſave us alive,</hi>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:123675:154"/> 
                  <hi>we ſhall live: and if they kill as we ſhall but die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And what they did ſo purpoſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve: they, fourthly forthwith did perform, and finiſh. <hi>They roſe up in the twilight to go unto the camp of the Syrians,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And the ſucceſſe was rich, and admirable: For they not onely relieved, refreſhed, and inriched themſelves, but their whole city alſo.</p>
               <p>No leſſe remarkable to this very purpoſe, is that Parable of the <hi>Prodigall:</hi> by which our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> himſelf intended a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual incouragement, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 17, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he came to himſelf: that is, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſenſible of his own calamity.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he was moved, and troubled, that his fathers hired ſervants, ſhould fare ſo much better then himſelf. <hi>How many hired ſervants of my fathers have bred enough, and to ſpare</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and I periſh with hunger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, he reſolveth to caſt himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his fathers compaſſion. <hi>I will ariſe, and go to my father, and ſay unto him, father: I have ſinned againſt heaven, and before thee,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And Fourthly, he puts his reſolution in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to action. <hi>And he aroſe and came to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:123675:155"/> And then behold his bleſſed enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, <hi>when he was yet a great way off, his father ſaw him, and had compaſſion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kiſſed him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the like happineſſe ſhall every ſoul receive. for certain, from her heavenly <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi> that hath a true ſenſe, and feeling of her tranſgreſſions: that is really moved, and troubled for them: that reſolveth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to forſake them: that proceedeth in the right courſe to be delivered from them. According to that <hi>life,</hi> which her <hi>Beloved</hi> brings along with him.</p>
               <p>But as the reſolutions and actions of the aforeſaid lepers, and likewiſe of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal, were undertaken and carried on meerly by neceſſity, and probably might have been as dangerous, as they proved advantagious.</p>
               <p>So in like caſe the ſoul that is thus new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revived, and ingaged upon the like compulſive principles, may be exceeding liable, and ſubject to many perilous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himſelf: it is not in man that walketh to direct his ſteps,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Prophet,</hi> Jere. 10. 23.</p>
               <p>And therefore whenſoever <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> appeareth ſavingly: to ſuch a ſoul he
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:123675:155"/> giveth <hi>light</hi> to rule and guide that <hi>life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thereupon the Apoſtle: <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead: and Chriſt ſhall give thee light,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 14.</p>
               <p>And thus the <hi>Lord</hi> of himſelf: <hi>I am the light of the world, he that followeth me ſhall not walk in darkneſſe, but ſhall have the light of life,</hi> John 8. 12.</p>
               <p>This is not a new light: But <hi>the true light, which lighteth every man, that cometh into the world,</hi> John 1. 9. Not an external, but an internal light: <hi>For God, who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, hath ſhined in our hearts,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
               <p>Not to inlighten the eyes of the body: but to inlighten the eyes of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the eyes of your underſtanding being inlightened,</hi> &amp;c. Saith the ſame <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The light of the body is the eye,</hi> ſaith our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Math. 6. 22.</p>
               <p>And as the light of the body is the eye: ſo the light of the ſoul is the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; For as the eye is that member of the body, whereby the body receiveth light: ſo the underſtanding is that faculty of the ſoul, whereby the ſoul receiveth light alſo.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:123675:156"/> And this ſpiritual light, albeit for ſubſtance it is alwayes the ſame. Yet in regard of the ſeveral proceedings, or degrees thereof, it may be ſaid to be threefold.</p>
               <p>The firſt degree is in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>God in Chriſt</hi> eſſentially. The ſecond is in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel</hi> exhibitively. The third is in the <hi>godly</hi> derivatively.</p>
               <p>Firſt (I ſay) this light is in <hi>God</hi> eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and originally: <hi>God is light</hi> ſaith S. <hi>John,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 5.</p>
               <p>And ſo it is infinite, perfect, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
               <p>Firſt it is infinite: It is ſaid that in the Creation, <hi>God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day,</hi> Gen. 1. 16.</p>
               <p>And that greater light is the <hi>Sun,</hi> Pſalm 136. 8.</p>
               <p>But there is no leſſe difference between this light of <hi>God,</hi> or this light which is <hi>God,</hi> and the light of the Sun, then there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween light and darkneſſe. The Sun can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhine in all places at one and the ſame time: for we ſee by experience, that the night hideth us from the light thereof. But thus the Prophet <hi>David</hi> unto the <hi>Lord: If I ſay, ſurely the darkneſſe ſhall cover me, even the night ſhall be light about me: yea, the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hideth not from thee, but the night ſhineth</hi>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:123675:156"/> 
                  <hi>as the day; the darkneſſe and the light are both alike unto thee,</hi> Pſal. 139. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>And <hi>upon whom doth not his light ariſe?</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> Job 25. 3.</p>
               <p>Verily this infinite light may not be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: It ſhineth upon all perſons, in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and at all times: And if any man be not inlightened thereby, it is for that, <hi>he loveth darkneſſe rather then light, becauſe his deeds are evil, as</hi> John 3. 19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this infinite light is perfect. <hi>God is light, and in him is no darkneſſe,</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 5.</p>
               <p>Neither is he capable of any the leaſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration. The Sun may be ſtayed in his courſe, as in the dayes of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> Joſh. 10. 13. Or turned back, as in the dayes of <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> Iſa. 38. 8.</p>
               <p>But in this <hi>Father of lights there is no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riableneſſe, neither ſhadow of turning,</hi> Ja. 1. 17. <hi>I am the Lord, I change not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Mala.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this perfect light is perpetual, or everlaſting. <hi>The Sun ſhall be turned into darkneſſe, and the Moon into bloud, before the great, and the terrible day of the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rd come,</hi> Joel. 2. 31. <hi>But the Lord ſhall be unto thee an everlaſting light,</hi> ſaith that Evangelical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60. 19. He ſhall not onely inligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:123675:157"/> thee all thy days in this his Kingdom of grace, but he ſhall be alſo thine onely light in his Kingdom of glorie, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 23.</p>
               <p>The ſecond degree of this everlaſting light, is in the everlaſting Goſpel: as S. <hi>John</hi> calleth it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 6. And here it is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable, conformable, and comfortable.</p>
               <p>Firſt it is communicable: As the Sun diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeth his light by his beams, ſo the <hi>Lord</hi> communicateth his light by his Goſpel. <hi>That grace, which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began: is now made manifeſt by the appearing of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who hath aboliſhed death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the Goſpel,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>And thereupon St. <hi>John: The darkneſſe is paſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and the true light now ſhineth.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>The darkneſſe of the Law, which was vailed under types, &amp; figures is done away, and the true light now ſhineth in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.</p>
               <p>And St. <hi>Peter</hi> thus: <hi>We have not followed cunningly deviſed fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, but were eye-witneſſes of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty: for he received from God the Father ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glorie, when there came ſuch a voice</hi>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:123675:157"/> 
                  <hi>to him from the excellent glorie: This is my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed. And this voice, which came from Heaven, we heard, when we were with him in the holy Mount. We have alſo a more ſure word of propheſie, whereunto ye do well that ye take heed: as unto a light that ſhineth in a dark place, untill the day dawn, and the day-ſtar ariſe in your hearts,</hi> 2 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
               <p>Briefly thus: The Goſpel of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaith he, is no fable: for we were eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of his Majeſty, and ear-witneſſes of his Fathers Teſtimony, altogether agreeable to the Records of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> which might ſerve to convince the Soul of ignorance, and unbelief, untill the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to reveal himſelf more abundantly by the light of his Goſpel.</p>
               <p>But it may be demanded, how <hi>God</hi> is ſaid to communicate, or diſcover his light by his Goſpel? ſeeing the Apoſtle telleth us: That the Goſpel <hi>is a myſterie, which hath been hid from ages, and from generations, and is now made manifeſt unto the Saints onely,</hi> Col. 1. 26. I anſwer, that the ſame Apoſtle doth very well reſolve this doubt in another place. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is hid to them that are loſt. In whom the God of this world, hath blinded the mindes of them, that</hi>
                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:123675:158"/> 
                  <hi>believe not, leaſt the light of the glorious Goſpel of Chriſt: who is the image of God ſhould ſhine unto them,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 3, 4.</p>
               <p>It is no wonder that the moſt glorious light be obſcured, and hidden from thoſe that are blinded: where the defect is not in the light, but in thoſe that cannot, or that will not ſee the light.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this light of the Goſpel is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable, or agreeable in every particular to whatſoever was covenanted, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by, and between <hi>God the Father,</hi> and his <hi>onely begotten Son,</hi> in, and by that <hi>eternal Covenant of Grace,</hi> for, and on the behalf of mankinde. And to this purpoſe the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> intimateth to the <hi>Epheſians: That into him this grace was given, that he ſhould preach among the Gentiles the unſearchable riches of Chriſt: And to make all men ſee what is the fellowſhip of the myſterie, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jeſus Chriſt: To the intent that now unto the principalities, and powers in heavenly places might be known by the Church, the manifold wiſdom of God. According to the eternal purpoſe, which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 7. to 12.</p>
               <p>Verily, this bleſſed light of the Goſpel is
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:123675:158"/> every way ſo conformable to the whole will of <hi>God:</hi> and ſo illuſtrated with the bright beams of his wiſdom, grace, and goodneſſe, <hi>That we all with open face beholding as in a glaſſe the glorie of the Lord, are changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſame image, from glorie to glorie, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, the light of the Goſpel is comfortable: <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted,</hi> ſaith the Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is the day-ſpring from on high, that hath viſited us: to give light to them that ſit in darkneſſe, and in the ſhadow of death, and to guide our feet into the way of peace,</hi> Luke 1. 78. 79. It ſheweth us the way to finde reſt unto our Souls, <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 29. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it aſſureth us that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is made unto us, wiſdom, and righteouſneſſe, and ſanctification, and redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30.</p>
               <p>And let every true Chriſtian be judge, if theſe be not ſuch comforts, as he chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth, or delighteth in.</p>
               <p>The third degree of light is in the <hi>Godly:</hi> And here it is regular, ſingular, and exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar.</p>
               <p>Firſt it is regular: It is guided by rule. By the rule of righteouſneſſe, the <hi>word of</hi>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:123675:159"/> 
                  <hi>God.</hi> He that is truely godly will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſee more then <hi>God</hi> ſheweth him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thy word have I hid in my heart: that I might not ſin againſt thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 119. 10. <hi>Thy word is a Lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my paths,</hi> ſaith the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>verſe</hi> 105.</p>
               <p>And therefore the <hi>Lord</hi> by his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah: To the law and to the teſtomonie</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>If they ſpeak not according to this word: it is, becauſe there is no light in them,</hi> Iſa. 8. 20.</p>
               <p>And therefore: <hi>Woe be unto them, that put darkneſſe for light, and light for darkneſſe,</hi> Iſa. 5. 20.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this light in the godly is ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, it looketh but one way, and that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If thine eye be ſingle, thine whole body ſhall be full of light: but if thine eye be evil, thy whole bodie ſhall be full of darkneſſe,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord,</hi> Mat. 6. 22. Where he intimateth that, that which is not a ſingle eye, is an evil eye. You know that a croſſe eye, that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to look one way, when in truth, it look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth another: is a great blemiſh in nature, but the eye of the Soul that is thus deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully affected, is a greater enemy to grace. <hi>Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids</hi>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:123675:159"/> 
                  <hi>look ſtraight before thee,</hi> ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 25.</p>
               <p>The eye of the godly looketh alwayes right forward upon <hi>Gods</hi> glory without any ſelf-ſeeing, or ſelf-ſeeking: But the blear-eyed hypocrite, when he moſt ſeemingly aymeth at <hi>Gods</hi> glory, he moſt deceitfully intendeth his own. And this is generally the common courſe of the world, <hi>For all ſeek their own: not the things that are Jeſus Chriſts,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 2. 21.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this light in the godly is exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plar. It ſetteth forth it ſelf to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, intimated, and improved. <hi>The path of the juſt is as the ſhining light: that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day,</hi> Prov. 4. 18.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Philipians.</hi>
               </p>

                     </gap>llowers together of me, and mark them, which walk ſo, as ye have us for an enſample,</hi> Phil. 3. 17. And to his beloved <hi>Timothy, Be thou an example of the believers in word, in converſation, in charity, in ſpirit, in faith, in purity,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 12. And thus our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to his Diſciples, <hi>Ye are the light of the world</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>A city that is ſet on an hill, cannot be hid, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do men light a candle, and put it under a buſhell, but on a candleſtick, and it giveth light to all that are in the houſe.

                  <hi>light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good work, and glorifie your father which is in heaven,</hi> Math. 5. 14, 15, 16.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay: what benefit ſhall the ſoul receive by all this <hi>light?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Truely ſhe ſhall hereby receive the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and compleateſt of all benefits. She ſhall be hereby inabled to ſee <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not according to his incomprehenſible eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and excellencies: theſe are things too high for the higheſt apprehenſions. <hi>He is high above all nations &amp; his glory above the heavens,</hi> Pſal. 113. 4. <hi>Higher then the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 8. For according to his ſecret councell, and inconceivable wiſdom: theſe are too deep for the deepeſt underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O the depth of the riches, both of the wiſdom, and knowledge of God! how unſearchable are his judgements, and his wayes paſt finding out. For who hath known the minde of the Lord, or who hath been his counceller?</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 11. 33, 34.</p>
               <p>But according to the good pleaſure of his own will: and the ſmall meaſure of our hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man capacity. For as the ſun it ſelf, as touching its matter, or ſubſtance, cannot be diſcerned by the eye of the body: and yet by the luſter, and bright beams there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:123675:160"/> we are inabled to ſee, whatſoever is neceſſary, or convenient to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>So our immortall, and inviſible <hi>God,</hi> as he is of himſelf, in himſelf, and to himſelf: cannot be perceived by the eye of the ſoul: yet by the evidence of his <hi>works,</hi> and of his <hi>word</hi> he is pleaſed to reveal himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, ſo far forth as is abundantly ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for our temporall ſatisfaction, and our eternall ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Theſe two large lectures of his <hi>works</hi> and <hi>words:</hi> are they wherein the <hi>Lord</hi> is ſeen, and read.</p>

               <p>The firſt, in the firſt ſix verſes. <hi>The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens declare the glory of God, and the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſheweth his handiwork,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to the</hi> 7 verſe.</p>
               <p>This is the leſſon of <hi>Philoſophy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That of <hi>Divinity</hi> is examplified from the <hi>ſixt</hi> to the <hi>twelfth verſe. The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the ſoul,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The mighty volume of the works of <hi>God</hi> may be peruſed by the light of nature: and it is ſo fairly, and ſo plainly written, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſoul, even as they run, may read it. What is he that ſees the heavens, and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:123675:161"/> earth, and thoſe innumerable creatures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them: And ſhall conſider their <hi>Originall:</hi> together with their <hi>Order, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe,</hi> and <hi>End, by which, in which, for which,</hi> and <hi>unto which,</hi> they were <hi>made, placed, fitted,</hi> and <hi>intended:</hi> but muſt confeſſe the wiſdom, power and Godhead of that great arm by which they were created. This is in brief, the lecture of <hi>Philoſophy:</hi> whereby the <hi>Lord</hi> doth manifeſt himſelf to every creature that is indued with Reaſon.</p>
               <p>The ſecond means, whereby we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to ſee, and know <hi>God,</hi> is by the light of his <hi>word.</hi> This is the ſafeſt, and moſt chriſtian way: This is <hi>Gods</hi> lecture of <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> where he preſents himſelf unto the eye of every knowing ſoul. But none can read it comfortably and effectually, but ſuch as are <hi>Partakers of the divine nature, as</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4.</p>
               <p>I know there are they, that eſteem them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves great politicians, and are indeed very worldly-wiſe men, who will be apt to ſay: do not we underſtand the holy Scriptures, and ſee <hi>God</hi> in them? what ſhould hinder us? Truly, I will not ſay, but ſuch as theſe, may read, and underſtand the word of <hi>God</hi> rationally, and morally: but not ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and ſavingly. <hi>Theſe things are written</hi>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:123675:161"/> 
                  <hi>that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that Believing, ye might have life through his name,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>John,</hi> John 20. 31.</p>
               <p>And thus to know <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>God in Chriſt,</hi> Is not <hi>from the fleſh, but from the Father which is in heaven,</hi> Mat. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>Again our onely <hi>Saviour</hi> telleth us: <hi>That the words, that he ſpeaketh, they are ſpirit,</hi> Jo. 6. 36.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul:</hi> That <hi>the law is ſpirituall,</hi> Rom. 7. 14. Now <hi>the naturall man receiveth, or perceiveth, not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe unto him: neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. But he that is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall judgeth, or diſcerneth, all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. 14, 15. But peradventure it will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded: How much may a judicious morall man ſee of <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>word,</hi> by the light of naturall reaſon, induſtry, and experience?</p>
               <p>Truely, I conceive that he may ſee, even as much, as the ſpirituall man ſeeth: one thing onely excepted; But without that one thing, he had as good or better ſee nothing.</p>
               <p>He is able to ſee <hi>God, as he is the creator of all things,</hi> Gen. 1. 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As he is <hi>the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, as,</hi> Gen. 17. 1. As he is <hi>a conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire, as,</hi> Deut. 4. 24. <hi>A God of gods, and</hi>
                  <pb n="306" facs="tcp:123675:162"/> 
                  <hi>Lord of lords, a great God, a mighty and a terrible, which regardeth not perſons, nor taketh rewards,</hi> as, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>The King eternall immortall, inviſible, and the onely wiſe God,</hi> as, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 17. Yea he may ſee him in a nearer relation: ſo near as to ſay, <hi>The Lord our God,</hi> as, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 4. <hi>Thou art our Father: our Redeemer,</hi> as, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 16. <hi>Our Saviour,</hi> as, <hi>Jude</hi> 25. But haply you will ſay that this is much for a naturall man to ſee and know, by the light of Reaſon: what would you have him know more? Truely let me tell you, all this is nothing worth: unleſſe he can ſee ſo far, as to ſay with good <hi>David: O Lord of hoſts, My King, and My God,</hi> Pſal. 84. 3.</p>
               <p>And with the penitent <hi>Prodigall. I will ariſe, and go unto my Father,</hi> Luke 15. 18.</p>
               <p>And with righteous <hi>Job: I know that My Redeemer liveth,</hi> Job 19. 25. And with the bleſſed mother of our <hi>Lord: My ſoul rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in God, My Saviour,</hi> Luke 1. 47.</p>
               <p>And with believing <hi>Paul, I live by the faith of the Son of God: who loved Me, and gave himſelf for Me,</hi> Gala. 2. 20.</p>
               <p>Theſe are ſuch proper and peculiar inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, as are diſcovered by the light of <hi>God:</hi> and none can ſee or know them ſavingly, but ſuch a one as is the childe of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="307" facs="tcp:123675:162"/>
               <p> And as this ſaving <hi>light</hi> directeth us unto the knowledge our <hi>Sovereign Lord:</hi> So it inſtructeth us to know our ſelves, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>God:</hi> and by this means, it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to entertain <hi>Humility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This the third obedient courtier, which ſtill attends upon that <hi>King</hi> of <hi>kings:</hi> And whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſeems to ſend before his face, as to prepare, &amp; uſher in his way into the new illuminated ſoul: Nor did there ever any ſoul injoy the ſaving preſence of her loving <hi>Lord,</hi> but by the conduct of this favorite. <hi>For God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble,</hi> James 4. 6.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>Peter</hi> doth adviſe us, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <hi>Be ye clothed with humility,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 5.</p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as he is much abuſed, by ſome that do uſurpe his name, and office al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in nature, they are nothing like him: I therefore ſhall endeavour to ſet forth four ſorts that do, and do pretend, to march under his colours, and aſſume his titles.</p>
               <p>And of theſe, the firſt is a treacherous <hi>Humility.</hi> The ſecond is a cowardly <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:</hi> The third is a conſtrained-humility: And the fourth is the true, and the ſound <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt, I ſay is a treacherous <hi>humility,</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="308" facs="tcp:123675:163"/>
               <p> And under this fair-ſeeming Cloak doth lurk many a foul perfidious deſign. The Prophet <hi>David</hi> in his deſcription of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. ſaith: <hi>That he crouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and humbleth himſelf, that the poor may fall by his ſtrong ones,</hi> verſe 10.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſtrange to any honeſt heart to ſee, how ſome will counterfeit <hi>humility:</hi> and caſt themſelves beneath their prouder thoughts, to gain the reputation of good men, good lowly men: but though they gull the world, the blear-eyed world: yet he that knows their hearts doth ſee for truth, that they are nothing ſo. And whoſoever ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their forgeries, ſhall finde at length that they are inſide Wolves, though outſide Sheep: Wolves in Sheeps cloathing: <hi>Ye ſhall know them by their fruits,</hi> ſaith our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Mat. 7. 16.</p>
               <p>Proud <hi>Abſolon</hi> conſpiring to depoſe his tender father <hi>David</hi> from his Kingdom, that he might wickedly uſurp the ſame: When any man <hi>came nigh to him, to do him obeyſance, he put forth his hand, and took him, and kiſſed him. And on this manner did</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalon <hi>to all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that came to the King for judgement, ſo</hi> Abſalon <hi>ſtole the hearts of the men of</hi> Iſrael, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>See here how this ambitious rebel hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:123675:163"/> himſelf, even to the loweſt, and worſt of the people; thereby promoting his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie, that ſo he might advance himſelf above the greateſt, and the beſt of Kings.</p>
               <p>And is it not a common thing with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to complement us with: <hi>your humble ſervant,</hi> when really and truely they eſteem it too little honour to be but our Maſters, unleſſe they may command us as their ſlaves.</p>
               <p>This is a treacherous <hi>humility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is a cowardly <hi>humility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And that is, when a man through fear of death, or bonds, or damage, or ſome ſuch like danger, humbles himſelf ſo far, as to ſubmit to the unworthy, or unjuſt commands of men in oppoſition to <hi>God,</hi> and a good conſcience: I do not ſay contrary to his own unhappy conſcience; for he that is a coward in <hi>Gods</hi> cauſe: is commonly as great a Tyrant over his own conſcience, he will not ſuffer it ſo much as to minde him of any of his vile abominations. <hi>He hath ſeared it</hi> (or burnt it as a ſlave) <hi>with a hot Iron.</hi> As the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 2. We read that the <hi>Perſian Monarch</hi> Ahaſuerus <hi>promoted</hi> Haman, <hi>&amp;c. And all the Kings ſervants that were in the Kings Gate, bowed, and reverenced</hi> Haman, <hi>for the King had ſo commanded,</hi> Eſth. 3. 1, 2.</p>
               <pb n="310" facs="tcp:123675:164"/>
               <p> But <hi>Mordecay (Gods</hi> true and faithfull ſervant) he bowed not, nor did him reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
               <p>He onely humbled himſelf to <hi>God:</hi> and <hi>God</hi> preſerved, and rewarded him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Humble your ſelves therefore under the mighty hand of God: that he may exalt you in due time,</hi> ſaith <hi>St. Peter,</hi> 1 Peter 5. 6. But <hi>who art thou, that thou ſhouldeſt be afraid of a man that ſhall die, and of the Sonne of Man, which ſhall be made as graſſe: and forgetteſt the Lord thy maker, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord by</hi> his Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 51. 12, 13.</p>
               <p>The third is a conſtrained <hi>humility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not conſtrained by the power, or compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Man, or by any other outward vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. But by the terrours of an accuſing conſcience. As when a Man is humbled, or dejected through the ſenſe, or apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or expectation of Divine Juſtice diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging it ſelf of ſome grievous plague, or puniſhment, either temporal, or eternal; preſent, or impendent: And this, of it ſelf is neither abſolutely hurtfull nor helpfull: but according to the fellowſhip, or ſociety that it lighteth upon. If it meeteth with ſelf-ends, then it becometh unfruitfull: If it meeteth with Hypocriſie, it proveth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible: If with deſpair it is damnable:
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:123675:164"/> But if it meeteth with <hi>faith,</hi> then it beco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth ſound and effectual.</p>
               <p>Firſt I ſay, if it lighteth upon ſelf-ends, it proveth unfruitfull. This we ſee in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Ahab:</hi> For <hi>Elijah</hi> having denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced moſt fearfull judgements againſt <hi>Ahab,</hi> his wife, and family: <hi>It came to paſſe, when</hi> Ahab <hi>heard thoſe words, that he rent his Cloaths, and put ſack-cloath upon his fleſh, and faſted, and lay in ſack-cloath, and went ſoftly,</hi> 1 Kings 21. 27.</p>
               <p>Inſomuch that the <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf took great notice thereof, <hi>verſe</hi> 29. Nevertheleſſe not long after <hi>Ahab</hi> ſet his heart upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> 1 Kings 22. 3. And in purſuance thereof, he expreſſed his hatred to <hi>Micaiah</hi> the true Prophet <hi>verſe</hi> 8. He deſpiſed the word of the <hi>Lord,</hi> verſe 18. He putteth <hi>Gods</hi> Prophet into priſon. <hi>ver.</hi> 27. And proceedeth in his deſigne, to his own deſtruction. Thus through his own ſelf-ends, his conſtrained <hi>humility</hi> became un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfull.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if this conſtrained humility be carried on by Hypocriſie, then it proveth contemptible. This appeareth in the words of the <hi>Lord</hi> by his Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> to the diſſembling <hi>Jews: Wherefore have we faſted</hi> (ſay they) <hi>and thou ſeeſt not? Wherefore have</hi>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:123675:165"/> 
                  <hi>we afflicted our Soul, and thou takeſt no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? Behold, in the day of your faſt you find pleaſure, and exact all your labours. Behold, ye faſt for ſtrife, and debate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Here are all the ſigns of a ſolemne <hi>humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation:</hi> but becauſe it was performed in Hypocriſie, the <hi>Lord</hi> poureth contempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
               <p>And therefore the <hi>Lord Chriſt</hi> in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on the Mount, exhorteth his Diſciples: ſaying: <hi>when ye faſt, be not as the Hypocrites of a ſad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to faſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Math.</hi> 6. 16. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And this faſting is a principal part of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation: as it appeareth by that of the Prophet <hi>David: I humbled my Soul with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35. 13.</p>
               <p>And by the deportments of the <hi>Jews</hi> in the time of <hi>Eſther,</hi> and <hi>Mordecay,</hi> Eſther, 4. 3.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, when this conſtrained <hi>humility</hi> incountreth with deſpair, it becometh dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and damnable. As in the example of <hi>Saul,</hi> who in his ſore diſtreſſe humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf even unto the Devil, in the likeneſſe of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 1 Sam. 28. 14.</p>
               <p>And of <hi>Judas</hi> the Traytour, who repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:123675:165"/> confeſſed, reſtored, and departed, and went and hanged himſelf, <hi>Math.</hi> 27. 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>But this <hi>humilitie,</hi> if it findeth out <hi>faith:</hi> then it proveth ſound, and effectual. Like that of <hi>Manaſſeh, who when he was in affliction beſought the Lord his God: and humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf greatly before the God of his fathers, and prayed unto him, and he was intreated of him, and heard his ſupplication; and brought him again to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>into his Kingdom. Then</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>knew that the Lord he was God,</hi> 2 Chr. 33. 12, 13.</p>
               <p>Neither was this kinde of <hi>humility</hi> leſſe remarkable in <hi>Saul</hi> the perſecuter, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, who being upon the height of his tyrannical intentions: <hi>Jeſus,</hi> whom he perſecuted, diſmounted him, and laid him on the earth, untill his cruel heart was ſo abaſed and humbled, that he trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and aſtoniſhed ſaid: <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? Acts</hi> 9. to the 7<hi rend="sup">th.</hi> 
                  <hi>verſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then upon whom, the mercy of <hi>God</hi> was never more freely beſtowed: Then by whom, the free grace of <hi>God in Chriſt,</hi> was never more excellently magnified.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yet I am the leaſt of the Apoſtles</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that am not meet to be called an Apoſtle: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I perſecuted the Church of Chriſt. But by the grace of God, I am what I am,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:123675:166"/> 9. 10. This is the work of a ſound <hi>humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> And it well deſerveth our ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. And therefore I ſhall endeavour to propound, and anſwer theſe four que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, what is this ſound <hi>humility?</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, by whom is it wrought?</item>
                  <item>Thirdly, how, or after what manner is it wrought?</item>
                  <item>And fourthly, what doth it work?</item>
               </list>
               <p>To the firſt queſtion it is anſwered: That <hi>humility</hi> is that work of regeneration, through which, our connſciences being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, and afflicted by the ſenſe of our ſins, and the conſideration of our own wants, and unworthineſſe: we do unfainedly confeſſe the ſame unto <hi>God,</hi> devoutly imploring his pardon for ſinne, together with a ſupply of ſpiritual grace.</p>
               <p>That this <hi>humility</hi> is a work of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thus qualified (I conceive) will not be denied nor contradicted. For ſo ſoon as that eternal goodneſſe of <hi>God</hi> appeareth unto his otherwiſe loſt creature: <hi>In beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him, of his own will, with the word of truth,</hi> as <hi>Ja.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
               <p>Immediately by the light of the ſame <hi>word,</hi> he beginneth to ſurvey himſelf: and to weigh all his thoughts, words, actions, and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:123675:166"/> abilities, according to this ballance of the ſanctuary. And finding them utterly void of all grace, and goodneſſe: and ſtuffed with nothing but ſin, and corruption. He burſteth out with the Prophet <hi>David</hi> in his 51. <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes by way of confeſſion: ſaying, <hi>I acknowledge my tranſgreſſions, and my ſin is ever before me,</hi> verſe 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me,</hi> verſe 5.</p>
               <p>Sometimes by way of petition for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his ſins: <hi>Purge me with Hyſope, and I ſhall be clean: Waſh me, and I ſhall be whiter then ſnow: Make me to hear of joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that the bones which thou haſt broken may rejoyce: hide thy face from my ſins, and blot out all mine iniquities,</hi> verſes 7. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Sometimes by way of ſupplication for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of ſpiritual grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Create in me a clean heart, O Lord, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new a right ſpirit within me. Caſt me not away from thy preſence, and take not thy holy Spirit from me. Reſtore unto me the joy of thy ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and uphold me with thy free Spirit,</hi> verſe 10. 11, 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe,</hi> verſe 15.</p>
               <p>And thus with <hi>David,</hi> the poor humble
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:123675:167"/> Soul bemoans her ſelf after a mournfull manner: yet in the midſt of all her paſſions, ſhe's confident to ſay with the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet: <hi>A broken, and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe,</hi> verſe 17.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Lord</hi> hath pronounced her bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and promiſed her comfort: ſaying,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comforted,</hi> Math. 5. 4.</p>
               <p>The ſecond queſtion is this:</p>
               <p>By whom is this <hi>humility</hi> wrought? To which I anſwer: By the <hi>Lord our God.</hi>

                  <hi>God maketh my heart ſoft,</hi> ſaith <hi>Job,</hi> Job 23. 16. <hi>Thou ſhalt remember all the way, which the Lord thy God led thee theſe fourty years in the wilderneſſe to humble thee, and to prove thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> to the Congregation of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> Deut. 8. 2. It was the <hi>Lord</hi> of heaven, that humbled the proud heart of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> King of all the earth, and made him a companion unto beaſts: whereby he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that he was no better then a beaſt in compariſon of the living <hi>God:</hi> Inſomuch, That <hi>he bleſſed the moſt high, and praiſed, and honoured him that liveth for ever,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. 33. 34.</p>
               <p>And becauſe his ſon, and ſucceſſour <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhazzar</hi> humbled not himſelf, though he knew all this, but lifted up himſelf againſt
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:123675:167"/> the <hi>Lord</hi> of heaven, the ſame <hi>Lord</hi> did put him into a condition worſe then of a beaſt: As appeareth by his deſperate agony, and his unexpected end, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>Now albeit, this abaſing, or humbling did work upon theſe mighty heathens, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then to manifeſt <hi>Gods</hi> more mighty power and Majeſty. Yet where it becometh effectual through <hi>faith:</hi> it fitteth and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth the heart, towards the attaining of everlaſting ſalvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the preparations of the heart are from the Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But how is this <hi>humility</hi> wrought? Or by what means doth our <hi>God</hi> work it in us? For this is the third queſtion.</p>
               <p>Verily it appeareth unto me, that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means whereby the <hi>Lord</hi> begins to break, and ſoften, and humble our rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious hard hearts, is by affliction, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſanctified unto us by the ſweet influence and operation of his holy <hi>Spirit:</hi> it direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us unto the <hi>Agent,</hi> the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and the <hi>Cure</hi> of all our miſeries, both outward, and inward, temporal, and eternal.</p>
               <p>Inſomuch that every one, who is become poor in ſpirit, will freely confeſſe with the Prophet <hi>David. I know, O Lord, that thy judgements are right: and that thou in faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe</hi>

                  <hi>haſt afflicted me,</hi> Pſalm 119. 75.</p>
               <p>For our better ſatisfaction in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: we muſt conſider, that we are all by nature proud, inſolent, diſobedient, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate. <hi>No man repenteth him of his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: ſaying, what have I done? Every one turneth to his courſe, as the horſe ruſheth into the battel,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 6.</p>
               <p>And that is fiercely, furiouſly, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly: untill the <hi>Lord,</hi> in pity of our Souls, claps his reſtraining bridles in our jaws: And to abate us of our deſperate ſpeed, layes burdens of afflictions on our backs, on ſome more heavy, and on ſome more light, according to his wiſdom and our temper: <hi>For he knoweth our frame, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth that we are duſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 103. 14.</p>
               <p>And when the <hi>Lord,</hi> with his afflicting hand, hath fill'd her with occaſions of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, the <hi>Soul</hi> beginneth to caſt down her pride, her ſtout behaviour, and her haughty looks: and to deviſe from whence thoſe woes proceed. And being now in this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, 'tis ten to one, but ſome of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, ſome miſerable carnal comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are ready to perſwade her, that her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes come by accident: by chance, by fortune, or by evil tongues, or by the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:123675:168"/> of the Stars, or by the malice of her enemies, or treachery of ſome deceitfull friends.</p>
               <p>And hereupon they will preſcribe her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies ſuteable to theſe deviliſh ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: To turn her eyes from looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>God:</hi> and ſo to drown her in a Sea of ſorrows.</p>
               <p>But, having now begun his work of grace, her <hi>God</hi> ſtrikes in, and ſends her to his word: where ſhe findeth: <hi>That affliction cometh not forth of the duſt, neither doth trouble ſpring out of the ground,</hi> Job 5. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

And being thus inſtructed, and confirmed in theſe, and the like godly principles, ſhe crieth out with mournfull Naomie: <hi>The Lord hath teſtified againſt me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me,</hi> Ruth. 1. 21.</p>
               <p>And having found the Agent to be <hi>God,</hi> ſhe knows the action muſt be juſt and right: <hi>For the Lord is righteous in all his wayes, and holy in all his works,</hi> Pſal. 145. 17.</p>
               <p>And going forward in her heavenly ſearch: She findes that <hi>God doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of men,</hi> Lam. 3. 33.</p>
               <pb n="320" facs="tcp:123675:169"/>
               <p> And therefore there is ſome impulſive cauſe, which doth conſtrain him to theſe ſad proceedings. Well, what is the cauſe for which the <hi>Lord</hi> afflicteth: why this his Church confeſſeth to be ſin. <hi>We roar all like Beares</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>and mourn ſore like Doves: we look for judgement, but there is none: for ſalvation, but it is far from us: For our tranſgreſſions are multiplied before thee, and our ſins teſtifie againſt us,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſai</hi> 59. 11, 12. &amp;c. And thus by the Prophet <hi>Jeremie. We lie down in our ſhame, and our confuſion covereth us: for we have ſinned againſt the Lord our God,</hi> Jerem. 3. 25. And this the Scriptures every where affirm.</p>
               <p>And what is <hi>ſin?</hi> why, <hi>ſin</hi> is the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the <hi>law,</hi> 1 John 3. 4.</p>
               <p>Reſolved thus: the <hi>Soul</hi> draws forth her life, and layes it to the level of the <hi>law,</hi> and findes it ſo repugnant to the rule: ſo crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, croſſe, deformed, and deſtructive: That now ſhe feels not, what ſhe hath received, but fears to think of what ſhe hath deſerved. Her ſorrow now is turned into anger: Anger againſt her ſelf, her ſinfull ſelf, ſhe wonders how the Juſtice of the <hi>Almighty</hi> hath ſpared her ſo long, and not inflicted the penalty that's due to her tranſgreſſions, eternal death in everlaſting torments.</p>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:123675:169"/>
               <p> And being thus affrighted at her ſins, the onely cauſe of her afflictions: the <hi>Soul</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirs her ſelf about the <hi>Cure.</hi> And to that end, ſhe ſighs, weeps, vowes, reſolves, and faſts, and prayes, and cries unto the <hi>Lord. Behold, O Lord, for I am in diſtreſſe: my bowels are troubled, mine heart is turned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me: for I have grievouſly rebelled,</hi> Lament. 1. 20.</p>
               <p>Bowels of grief beg bowels of compaſſion, and all to little purpoſe: For now the more ſhe mourns, the more ſhe may, her ſpirit is ingaged in the conflict. <hi>And a wounded ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who can bear,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 18. 14. Poor Soul for life ſhe labours; does, undoes: ſhe ſpends her ſpirits, and torments her ſelf; and all to ſatisfie incenſed Juſtice. Which ſhe is never able to perform by her own paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, were they ſtrong as death, and deep as hell. The Law is broken, and it is <hi>Gods</hi> Law: her ſute is entred; and her caſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, one day of hearing craveth for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, night unto night doth utter lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Juſtice muſt be appeas'd, or no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, every hour freſh ſummons to the barr: ſhe gives attendance, but receives no comfort: her time runs on, her taske is but begun: her work is always doing, never ended: And ſo her caſe ſeems to be deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate:
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:123675:170"/> Becauſe ſhe ſeeketh not the cure by <hi>Chriſt:</hi> by <hi>God in Chriſt. Oh! there is heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſick!</hi> That very name revives her: and commands her ears and heart to dwell upon that ſound, which they ſuck in with a delitious reliſh. For now that <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man:</hi> that <hi>Mediator</hi> (not won by tears) but of his own free grace, turns o're the mighty volume of his book: the glorious records of free-election, and finds her name written in that <hi>Book of life,</hi> Revela. 3. 5.</p>
               <p>And now though haply he may forbear for ſome ſhort time to utter his affections, until her heart be throughly mollified, and well prepared to receive impreſſion: yet he forgets not to compaſſionate the pining wretch, but in the beſt of times: his own good time, he ſays concerning her, like as he did concerning <hi>Ephraim. Is this my dear daughter? is ſhe a pleaſant child? for ſince I ſpake againſt her I do earneſtly remember her ſtill, therefore my bowels are troubled for ber, I will ſurely have mercy on her,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord,</hi> Jer. 31. 20.</p>
               <p>And to her ſelf, as to his ſpouſe, he ſaith. <hi>O my dove! that art in the clefts of the rock, in the ſecret places of the ſtairs, let me ſee thy countenance, let me hear thy voice: for ſweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comly,</hi> Cant. 2. 14.</p>
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:123675:170"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with everlaſting kindneſſe will I have mercy on thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54. 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>And thus her <hi>Lord</hi> bemoanes, and greets, and cheers her, till being big with <hi>Chriſt</hi> her <hi>comforter,</hi> ſhe ſingeth with the bleſſed virgin <hi>Mary: My ſoul doth magnifie the Lord, and my ſpirit hath rejoyced in God my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. For he hath regarded the lowe eſtate of his handmaiden,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 1. 46, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a happy progreſſe, you may ſay: But where appeareth this <hi>humility?</hi> Truely ſhe meets with it in every paſſage.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſhe ſurvayes her ſorrows, and ſhe ſays, <hi>Remembering mine affection, and my miſery, the wormwood and the gall: my ſoul hath them ſtill in rememberance, and is hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in me,</hi> Lament. 3. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, ſhe ſees the work of <hi>God</hi> in her afflictions: and therefore, <hi>She hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth her ſelf under the mighty hand of God.</hi> According as St. <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth her, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, perceiving ſin to be the cauſe of all her miſeries; ſhe humbly begs to have it done away. <hi>Have mercy upon me, O God</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>according to thy loving kindneſſe: according to the multitude of thy tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies blot out my tranſgreſſions: waſh me through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:123675:171"/> 
                  <hi>from mine iniquitie, and cleanſe me from my ſin,</hi> as, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>And with like meekneſſe promiſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment. <hi>I have born chaſtiſement,</hi> (ſaith ſhe) <hi>I will not offend any more,</hi> as, <hi>Job</hi> 34. 31. But Juſtice pleads for ſatisfaction, <hi>The ſoul</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that ſinneth, it muſt die.</hi> At this the poor ſoul ſeems as dead indeed: ſhe's utterly dejected, quite caſt down. She's not ſo ſtiff in her opinion, to bring in writs of errour, or falſe-judgement. All that ſhe deſires, is to obtain the mercy of the Book: where ſhe is taught to read. <hi>The wages, indeed, of ſin is death: But the gift of God is eternall life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Rom. 6. 23.</p>
               <p>And here ſhe breathes: for here's the breath of life. And thus reſtor'd ſhe hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thanks the law, her ſchole-maſter for bringing her to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> She hangs upon this promiſe: claims this <hi>gift,</hi> and by this <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> her <hi>Surty,</hi> ſhe tenders ſatisfaction unto Juſtice; and is diſmiſſed without coſt, or dammage. And not ſo onely: But ſhe's made an heir, <hi>an heir of God, and a joynt-heir with Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 8. 17.</p>
               <p>And is ſhe proud of this preferment now? No verily: Till now ſhe never felt the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly force of ſound <hi>humility.</hi> All her <hi>humilty</hi>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:123675:171"/> unto this preſent, was meerly legal, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, and ſlaviſh: but now 'tis evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and free, or if it be conſtrained any way: It is conſtrained by the love of Chriſt, Indeed. <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth her, becauſe ſhe thus judgeth, that if one died for all: then were all dead,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14.</p>
               <p>If all were dead, then ſhe amongſt the reſt, And that ſhe now lives, or begins to live, 'tis onely by the purchace of his grace, He died the death, that ſhe deſerved to die, that ſhe may live with him eternally. And <hi>where is boaſting then? it is excluded, By what law? of works? Nay, but by the law of faith,</hi> Rom. 3. 27.</p>
               <p>Now ſhe believes, and loves, and hence proceeds a modeſt, willing, ſweet humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. She's not dejected through a ſervile fear: but ſhe is humbled by attractive love, Becauſe her <hi>Lord</hi> requires to have it ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take my yoak upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek, and lowly in heart,</hi> ſaith her beloved <hi>Lord,</hi> Math. 11. 29.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let this minde be in you, which was alſo in Chriſt Jeſus: who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equall with God: But made himſelf of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a ſervant, and was made in the likeneſſe of men. And being found in</hi>
                  <pb n="326" facs="tcp:123675:172"/> 
                  <hi>faſhion as a man, he humbled himſelf, &amp; became obedient unto death, even the death of the croſſe,</hi> ſaith his learned Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 5. to the 9.</p>
               <p>Thus councel wooes her, and example wins her: And ſhe walkes humbly with her <hi>God in Chriſt.</hi> According to that of the Prophet, <hi>Micah</hi> 6. 8. And thus effectuall <hi>humility</hi> is brought, and wrought into the ſinful ſoul.</p>
               <p>But what doth this <hi>humility</hi> perform? what doth it work? For that is the fourth Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. I anſwer, that this true <hi>humility,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impowred, and improved by <hi>Faith:</hi> hath principally theſe five operations, It <hi>inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, diſpoſeth, removeth, reneweth,</hi> and <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, it inſtructs the new-inlightened ſoul in thoſe hereditary imperfections, which pride would never ſuffer her to look on: ſo as to own them with a free conſent, as the onely off-ſpring of her curſed nature. But being humbled, ſhe can plainly ſee ſin, and corruption in every corner, defiling all her thoughts, and words, and deeds. And thereupon ſhe willingly confeſſeth, <hi>That every imagination of the thoughts of her heart, is onely evill continually,</hi> as, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That her tongue is an unruly evill, full of deadly poyſon,</hi> as, <hi>James</hi> 3. 8.</p>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:123675:172"/>
               <p> Inſomuch, that ſhe hath <hi>wearied the Lord with her words,</hi> as, <hi>Mala.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
               <p>And <hi>that ſhe loveth darkneſſe rather then light, becauſe her deeds are evil,</hi> as, <hi>John</hi> 3. 19.</p>
               <p>And looking back upon her ſinfull cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſhe feelingly complaineth with St. <hi>Paul, what fruit had I then in thoſe things, whereof I am now aſhamed: for the end of thoſe things is death,</hi> Rom. 6. 21.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>humility</hi> inſtructeth her in her own wants, her ſpiritual poverty, for whereas pride endeavours to perſwade her: That <hi>ſhe is rich and increaſed in goods, and hath need of nothing: humility informs her, That ſhe is wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blinde, and naked,</hi> as, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>So that in her there dwelleth no good thing,</hi> Rom. 7. 18.</p>
               <p>And having ſhown her that ſhe is full of evil, and void or empty of all grace, and goodneſs: <hi>humility</hi> proceedeth to inſtruct her in her own weakneſs; which is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream: that ſhe hath neither power to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs her wickedneſs, nor to ſupply her wants, <hi>we are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing, as of our ſelves: but our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency is of God, ſaith Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 5.</p>
               <p>Thus the poor ſoul learns to be ſenſible, of her own wickedneſs, and wants, and weakneſs.</p>
               <pb n="328" facs="tcp:123675:173"/>
               <p> And from this feeling ſenſe <hi>humility</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Poſeth her to ſeek relief, whereby her ſins may be ſuppreſt: her wants ſupply'd, and her much weakneſs pitied, and ſupported. O how ſhe ſtruggles in this three-fold ſnare! how ſhe endeavous to releaſe her ſelf! But all in vain until a voice from heaven di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recteth her to take the little book out of the great and mighty angels hand, <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. <hi>The Goſpel in the hand of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by his directon, ſhe findeth. <hi>That he is that Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſin of the world,</hi> John 1. 19. <hi>That the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin,</hi> 1 John 1. 7. And that, <hi>He hath loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood,</hi> Revel. 1. 5. Here ſhe ſees how her ſins are waſht away: and how ſhe is ſo clearly cleanſed from them, that ſhe is freed for ever from that bondage.</p>
               <p>Again ſhe reads, <hi>That in him dwelleth all the fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily,</hi> Colo. 2. 9. And, that <hi>of his fulneſſe we have all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and grace for grace,</hi> John 1. 16.</p>
               <p>Here ſhe perceives her wants are all ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, and that in him ſhe's fully furniſhed, And to ſuſtain her in her preſent weakneſs, ſhe hears him ſay to her, as to St. <hi>Paul, My grace is ſufficient for thee: for my ſtrength is</hi>
                  <pb n="329" facs="tcp:123675:173"/> 
                  <hi>made perfect in weakneſſe,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 9.</p>
               <p>Until ſhe comes experimentally to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph with that mighty man of <hi>God. I can do all things through Chriſt, which ſtrenghen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me,</hi> Phil. 4. 13.</p>
               <p>And having taſted of theſe heavenly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, ſhe ruminates upon this little book, from whence ſhe ſucketh ſuch exceeding ſweetneſs, that now ſhe ſingeth with the Prophet <hi>David: How ſweet are thy words unto my taſte, yea ſweeter then hony to my mouth,</hi> Pſal. 119. 103.</p>
               <p>But yet before ſhe fully can diſgeſt this book, ſhe findes it bitter in her belly. For looking back upon her ſinfull wayes, ſhe ſees how ill ſhe hath requited theſe incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable favours: How ſhe hath grieved the <hi>Spirit of her Lord, and crucified the Son of God a freſh.</hi> And <hi>looking upon him, whom ſhe hath pierced, ſhe mourneth for him, as one mourneth for his onely ſon, and as is bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for him, as one that is in bitterneſſe for his firſt born.</hi> According to that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Zechar.</hi> 12. 10. Now ſin appeareth in its proper colours, foul, filthy, beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and abominable. So that the ſoul begins to hate her ſelf, for loving ſuch a baſe deformed monſter, ſo ſpightfull, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous, and damnable, that nothing can
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:123675:174"/> be more pernitious. And being thus incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt ſin: theres nothing can content her, but her <hi>Saviour.</hi> She doth not cry with <hi>Rachel, give me children,</hi> but give ne <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, or elſe I die.</hi> She is extreamly ſick of her corruptions, and none but <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> muſt be her Phyſitian: ſhe ſeeks no other Phyſick, but his favour; no antidote, but his affection: no balſom, but his blood: and therefore ſhe will entertain him upon any tearms though never ſo offenſive to the fleſh: for ſhe hath found, that <hi>There is none other name under heaven, whereby we muſt be ſaved,</hi> Acts 4. 12.</p>
               <p>And now by vertue of <hi>humility,</hi> that moſt obedient child of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> the care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſoul endeavours to remove all ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments as may obſtruct, the ſweet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of her beloved <hi>Lord.</hi> And knowing ſin to be the onely thing that cauſeth their unhappy ſeparation, as, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 2. She cries unto her ſtrength, and her <hi>Redeemer</hi> for help againſt that falſe infernal foe: that ſeeks to keep her ſtill in his diſpleaſure. And being ayded by her <hi>Saviour,</hi> and arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his well approved armour, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She ſetteth firſt upon thoſe crying ſins, that are of greateſt obloquie, and ſcandal:
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:123675:174"/> and having routed thoſe prodigions rebels, ſhe ranſacks every corner of her conſcience and haling forth her more concealed crimes, ſhe ſends them packing: ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns her ſelf of ſloath, ſelf-ſaving and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie: ſhe crucifies her own corrupted nature, and mortifies her moſt beloved luſts: ſhe ſuffers not a peeviſh thought to paſs without a ſerious examination, and a ſevere impartial reproof. <hi>For the weapons of her warfare are not carnall, but mighty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds: caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down imaginations, and every high thing, that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God: and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chriſt.</hi> According to that of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>But for as much as pride, rebellious pride, is evermore her mortal enemy. The child of ignorance: the Divels darling, the ſoul of ſchiſm, the ſtrength of hereſie, the food of ſpight, the fuell of contention, the fools affiance, and the wiſe mans fear, the bane of godlineſs, the death of grace, hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and hurtful to his members. Therefore this humble ſoul conſtrains her ſelf to caſt out this deſtructive adverſary: and hold him in perpetual defiance. And thus, that ſhe may gain her gracious <hi>Lord,</hi>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:123675:175"/> ſhe labours mightily to take away the evil of her doings from his eyes: To which ſhe cannot yet conceive her ſelf to be a pleaſing Object. For though ſhe could cleanſe her ſelf from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit; according to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> incouragement, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. Yet ſhe muſt likewiſe <hi>perfect holineſs in the fear of God. And be renewed in the ſpirit of her minde, And put on that new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe,</hi> as, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 23, 24. Or ſhe eſteems her ſelf unfit for <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the beauties, that her <hi>Lord</hi> delights in: And therefore now ſhe ſeeks to deck her ſelf with theſe new ornaments.</p>
               <p>Not with <hi>broyded hair, or gold, or pearls, or coſtly aray,</hi> as good St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 9.</p>
               <p>And yet much leſſe will ſhe deform her ſelf, according to the faſhions of this world.</p>
               <p>But ſhe endeavours to adorn her ſelf, <hi>in the hidden man of the heart, in that, which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit, which in the ſight of God is of great price.</hi> According to St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> exhortation, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3, 4.</p>
               <p>And being thus arayed, and adorned with precious robes inſtead of ſpecious rags: beyond the power or police of nature, and paſt the induſtry of humane art, She ſeeks
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:123675:175"/> the good hand of her <hi>God</hi> upon her, for which ſhe humbly magnifies his grace, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as in <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> Propheſie, <hi>I will greatly rejoyce in the Lord, my ſoul ſhall be joyfull in my God: for he hath cloathed me with the garments of ſalvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteouſneſſe as a bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom decketh him ſelf with Ornaments, and as a bride adorneth her ſelf with her jewells</hi> Iſa. 61. 10. And thus attired with all <hi>humility</hi> ſhe waiteth to receive her ſoveraign <hi>Lord,</hi> and panting for his moſt deſired preſence: ſhe ſings, as in the ſong of <hi>Solomon: ſtay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am ſick of love,</hi> Cant. 2. 5. <hi>Set me as a ſeal upon thy heart: as a ſeal upon thine arm, for love is ſtrong as death,</hi> Cant. 8. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Make haſte my beloved, and be thou like to a Roe, or to a young hart upon the mountains of ſpices,</hi> Cant. 8. 14.</p>
               <p>And now her bleſſed <hi>Lord,</hi> who all this while: from <hi>the</hi> firſt in ſtant of her new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wrought ſecretly upon her ſinful heart, melting it in the furnace of affliction: diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the Agent, cauſe; and cure of all her miſeries: inſtructing her in her own ſinfulneſſe, and wants, and weakneſſe: diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing her to ſeek and find relief, remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all occaſions of offence: and renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:123675:176"/> her to his own likeneſſe, And all this by the level of <hi>humility,</hi> the firſt, and fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fruit of <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>love.</hi> Now he appears to her more viſibly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſſe, ſhineth in her heart to give the light of the knowledge of the glorie of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
               <p>At which the poor Soul fares as one tranſported: Not by the ſpirit of illuſion, of pride, vain glory, or Hypocriſie: like thoſe that labour to diſhonour <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his eternal Mediatorſhip by their conditional Election, that magnify the broken arm of fleſh by their free-will, and carnal confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that wreſt the word of <hi>God</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Scripture by reaſon, that will make the Law of none effect by their traditions, that do deſpiſe, rule, order, government, and lift themſelves above <hi>Gods</hi> Ordinances, that make their Chriſtian liberty the Cloak for their ambition, avarice and envy, that dare with ſhameleſſe impudence proclaim themſelves for Saints, whereas their practice proves, that they are altogether otherwiſe: That ſay, <hi>ſtand by thy ſelf, come not near to me, for I am holier then thou: Theſe are a ſmoak in my noſe, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord, Iſa.</hi> 65. 5.</p>
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:123675:176"/>
               <p> But in the ſpirit of a meek ſound minde, with upright <hi>Job</hi> ſhe ſayes unto the <hi>Lord I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye ſeeth thee. Wherefore I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes,</hi> Job 42. 5. 6. And with that Evangelical <hi>Iſaiah: wo is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midſt of a people of unclean lips, for mine eyes have ſeen the Lord of Hoſts,</hi> Iſa. 6. 5.</p>
               <p>And with that good Centurion, ſhe ſaith: <hi>Lord I am not worthy that thou ſhouldeſt come under my roof,</hi> Math. 8. 8.</p>
               <p>And thus the nearer that her <hi>Lord</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procheth, with his pure, ſpotleſſe, glorious perfections: the more unworthy ſhe eſteems her ſelf: untill ſhe ſeems unto her ſelf as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: Yea, worſe then nothing. All her braveries, her beauties, honours, pleaſures, wit, and wealth are lying Witches, all her fair profeſſions are painted Vizards of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie: her moral vertues, and moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious parts, are filthy garments ſpotted by the fleſh. For ſo ſhe values them, and caſts them from her: And having ſtript her ſelf of all ſuch rags, ſhe humbly layes her ſelf at her <hi>Lords</hi> feet: ſaying, as <hi>Ruth</hi> did ſometime ſay to <hi>Boaz, I am thine handmaid, ſpread therefore thy skirt over thine hand-maid,</hi> Ruth. 3. 9.</p>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:123675:177"/>
               <p> And whereſoever this <hi>Humility</hi> hath wrought this work: No doubt but <hi>Chriſt</hi> is there, and brings aſſurance as his next at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant.</p>
               <p>And ſo it followeth in the fourth place: That whereſoever <hi>Chriſt</hi> is there is <hi>Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In him we have boldneſſe, and acceſſe with confidence, by the faith of him,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph. 3. 12.</p>
               <p>And that ſtrong fortreſſe wherein this <hi>Aſſurance</hi> is to be lodged, and eſtabliſhed, is the free promiſes of <hi>God in Chriſt,</hi> according to the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are too many that do ſeek for this <hi>Aſſurance</hi> in their own ſanctification.</p>
               <p>And that in order to their victories over their ſins, &amp; their abilities to ſerve their <hi>God</hi> according to the rule of his Commandments. And this, I muſt confeſſe, is a fair building, but yet exceeding ſubject to the blaſted in time of tryal and temptation: when every filching undermining ſin ſhall catch occaſion to break in, and ſhake, or ſhatter all, or part of their <hi>Aſſurance:</hi> But that <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> which is fortified by the ſure promiſes of <hi>God in Chriſt,</hi> is much more ſafe, ſecure, and ſatisfying. Wherefore if thine <hi>Aſſurance</hi> ſteps aſide, and ſeems to ſlight thee, fly unto the

               <p>What Soul can wiſh a more compleat aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance?</p>
               <p>But haply you will ſay, we do not doubt, but every true believer is ſure enough to have eternal life by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> But what aſſurance have we of thoſe good things, that do concern this life?</p>
               <p>Indeed the Prophet <hi>David</hi> telleth us: <hi>There be many that ſay, who will ſhew us any good,</hi> Pſal. 4. 6.</p>

               <p> But in this caſe alſo, we have both pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, example, and experience for our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance. For matter of promiſe: <hi>God</hi> hath ſaid, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee;</hi> Heb. 13. 5.</p>
               <p>But what is it, poor Soul, thou art afraid of? Art thou afraid of poverty, or want?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why, a little that a righteous man hath, is better then the riches of many wicked. For the arms of the wicked ſhall be broken: but the Lord upholdeth the righteous. The Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the dayes of the upright, and their inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhall be for ever: They ſhall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed in the evil time, &amp; in the dayes of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine they ſhall be ſatisfied,</hi> Pſ. 37. 16, 17. 18, 19.</p>

               <p>But why ſhould any man be ſuch a cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, as to fear an enemy that is already conquered: Yea, aboliſhed, or deſtroyed, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Swallowed up in victory,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 54.</p>

For where the true <hi>Chriſt</hi> is there is <hi>aſſurance.</hi> And this <hi>aſſurance</hi> always brings in peace.</p>
               <p>This is the fifth attendant, that ſtill waits upon the perſon of our royal <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> And where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is, you cannot want for Peace. He is <hi>The mighty God, the everlaſting Father: The Prince of Peace,</hi> Iſa. 9. 6.</p>
               <p>But as there is ſcarce any kingdom, where there are not three ſelf-ended ſichophants, for one true-hearted, faithful, loyal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. So there are four ſorts or kinds of peace: yet onely one that is ſecure; or ſafe.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>The firſt ſort of peace, is a ſluggiſh peace.</item>
                  <item>The ſecond is a ſlaviſh peace.</item>
                  <item>The third is a deceitful peace.. And</item>
                  <pb n="344" facs="tcp:123675:181"/>
                  <item> The fourth is the ſafe peace.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The firſt (I tell you) is a ſluggiſh peace. And this is when a man lies ſnorting in the filthy boſom of a ſinful, corrupt converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without any feeling of <hi>Gods</hi> fierce wrath, or of his own deſperate condition; as being ſubject even that very inſtant, to be ſwallowed up of that moſt horrible and dreadful gulph of everlaſting death, and endleſſe torments.</p>
               <p>This kinde of ſluggiſh <hi>peace</hi> is very much illuſtrated by <hi>Jonah</hi> his example, in the firſt <hi>Chapter</hi> of his hiſtory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the <hi>Lord</hi> commandeth <hi>Jonah</hi> to go and cry againſt <hi>Nineveh.</hi> But <hi>Jonah</hi> diſobeyeth <hi>Gods</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and goeth down to <hi>Joppa:</hi> where finding a ſhip bound for <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> he pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the fare thereof, and goeth down there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, to fly unto <hi>Tarſhiſh,</hi> from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the <hi>Lord.</hi> And in the middeſt of that mighty tempeſt, whereby the ſhip is likely to be broken: <hi>Jonah</hi> is laid faſt a ſleep in the ſides of the ſhip, until the <hi>Ship-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> rouzeth him up, and ſoon after caſteth him over-board into the raging Ocean. So <hi>the Lord commandeth all men every where to repent,</hi> Acts 17. 30. He exhorteth us to <hi>watch,</hi> and to <hi>ſtand faſt in the faith,</hi> 1 Cor. 16. 13.</p>
               <pb n="345" facs="tcp:123675:181"/>
               <p> And <hi>to examine our ſelves, whether we be in the faith,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 5. Nevertheleſſe we wilfully rebel againſt the <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>God:</hi> we do deſpiſe his Precepts, and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations: and ſlighting his Ordinances, we betake our ſelves unto the ſloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full cabin of ſecurity, <hi>we ſay in our hearts, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face he will never ſee it.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh of a wicked perſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10, 11. And to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves the more ſincerely: we keep at a diſtance with our own hearts, and make our ſelves great ſtrangers even at home, in our own conſciences, <hi>we do evill, and hate the light, neither come we to the light, leaſt our deeds ſhould be reproved.</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that ſaying of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> John 3. 20. From whence it proceedeth, that like fools, we go laughing to the correction of the ſtocks: &amp; never fear the rod, until we feel it.</p>
               <p>And thus, with <hi>Jonah,</hi> we ſleep peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably even in the jawes of danger and diſtreſſe, and never dreame of our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching ruine. Or if at any time the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours of conſcience do hap do ſeize upon us, and afright us: yet they are but as ſo many troubleſome dreams, we ſoon forget, and fall a ſleep again, untill <hi>the day of the Lord cometh, as a thief in the night: And</hi>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:123675:182"/> 
                  <hi>when we ſay peace, and ſafety, then ſuddain deſtruction cometh upon us, as travail upon a woman with child, and we ſhall not eſcape,</hi> as in the 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 2, 3. This is the ſluggiſh peace.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is a ſlaviſh <hi>peace;</hi> when a man is contented to ſubmit unto the ſlavery of ſin and Satan without endeavouring, or deſiring to <hi>recover himſelf out of the ſnare of the Devill, but is taken captive by him at his will,</hi> as, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26.</p>
               <p>To inſtance in one onely particular. Is it not a ſad thing to ſee how moſt men and women do more willingly and chearfully ſerve the Devil every hour in the day; then they will ſerve <hi>God</hi> one day in the week? yea and in that day (I mean the Sabbath day, which <hi>God</hi> hath ſet apart for his own publick worſhip) if we ſhall conſider, how few will afford him their preſence for one hour, and how many of thoſe few do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy that hour in wandring thoughts or worſe behaviour, rather then in ſincere, and pure devotion: verily we ſhall finde that of the Apoſtle to be too too true. <hi>That even the whole world liveth in wickedneſſe,</hi> 1 John 5. 19. Lieth in wickedneſſe: not ſo much as attempting to ſtir out of it, on to ſtrive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. And is not this to ſerve <hi>God</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpightfully:
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:123675:182"/> and the Devil obſequiouſly. Indeed this may ſeem to be a kinde of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>peace:</hi> but it is very diſhonourable, and no leſſe dangerous, to hold the Devil in friendſhip, and <hi>God</hi> at defiance.</p>
               <p>For whileſt we do thus promiſe unto our ſelves comfort, and ſecurity, by ſiding with <hi>Satan,</hi> and complying with our own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuptions: we do betray our moſt hopeful expectations to all manner of temporal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction: and our poor ſouls to eternal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. According to that of the <hi>Lord</hi> by this Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, Becauſe ye have ſaid, we have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreement: when the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing ſcourge ſhall paſſe through, it ſhall not come unto us: for we have made lies our refuge, and under falſhood we have hid our ſelves,</hi> Iſa. 28. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord: Your covenant with death ſhall be diſanulled, and your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with hell ſhall n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t ſtand: when the everflowing ſcourge ſhall paſſe through, then ye ſhall be troden down by it. From the time that it goeth forth, it ſhall take you: for morning by morning ſhall it paſſe over by day and by night: and it ſhall be a vexation onely to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the report,</hi> Iſa. 28. <hi>at the</hi> 18 <hi>and</hi> 19 verſes.</p>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:123675:183"/>
               <p> The third is a deceitful <hi>peace:</hi> And this is, when a man buildeth his <hi>peace</hi> upon falſe foudations: And that either through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or through errour. Firſt through ignorance: as when we either know no danger at all, or elſe when we do not know our danger to be ſo great, as in truth it is. When a man knoweth no danger, he fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no danger: and therefore he is as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of his own ſecurity, as he that is altogether free from danger. And likewiſe he that conceiveth not his danger to be ſo great, as in truth it is: albeit he hath not ſo much <hi>peace,</hi> as he that is altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, yet he imagineth that his danger is not ſo great, as that it requireth much trouble, or travail to prevent or avoid it. <hi>But all the ſinners of my people ſhall die by the ſword, which ſay; the evil ſhall not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, nor prevent us,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord,</hi> Amos 9. 10.</p>
               <p>And in the ſixth <hi>Chapter</hi> of the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, at the <hi>third verſe,</hi> &amp;c. to the eighth: <hi>Ye that put far away the evil day, and cauſe the ſeat of violence to come near, that lye upon beds of Ivory, and ſtretch themſelves upon their Couches, and eat the Lambs of the flock, and the Calves out of the midſt of the ſtall: that chaunt to the ſound of the Viol, and invent to</hi>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:123675:183"/> 
                  <hi>themſelves inſtruments of Muſick, like</hi> David: <hi>that drunk Wine in bowls, and anoint them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the chief oyntments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of</hi> Joſeph. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now ſhall they go captive, with the firſt that go captive,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſort of theſe deluded Souls are ſuch, as ground their peace upon mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes: perſwading themſelves that <hi>God</hi> is, as it were, ingaged to defend, and preſerve them: And why? Becauſe, ſay they, he is mercifull: It is true indeed, the <hi>Lord</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mercifull: For ſo he proclaimeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>But what is all that to thee! <hi>He will by no means clear the guilty,</hi> as in the ſame 7th. <hi>verſ. God</hi> cannot be ſo mercifull as to be unjuſt: his juſtice muſt be fully ſatisfied; which thou art never able to perform. And therefore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe the guilt of thy ſins be waſhed away by the bloud of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> thou haſt no preſent intereſt in <hi>Gods</hi> mercy. Thou art ſtill in thy wickedneſſe. And <hi>the wicked are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt. There is no peace (ſaith my God) to the wicked,</hi> Iſa. 57. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>Now every one of theſe three ſorts of peace is ſuch a judgement, as expoſeth us to <hi>Gods</hi> juſt wrath, and indignation.</p>
               <pb n="350" facs="tcp:123675:184"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>For he that bleſſeth himſelf in his heart, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſhall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart, to add drunkenneſſe to thirſt. The Lord will not ſpare him: but then the anger of the Lord, and his jealouſie ſhall ſmoak againſt that man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>But the fourth ſort of <hi>peace,</hi> is a ſafe <hi>peace.</hi> And this is that, which doth inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably attend upon the perſon of our <hi>Lord.</hi> And for our better underſtanding, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in this particular, we muſt know, that this true <hi>peace</hi> muſt be grounded upon the <hi>aſſurance</hi> of that reconciliation, which <hi>God in Chriſt</hi> hath concluded between him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and us. For <hi>it pleaſed the father that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell: And (having made peace through the bloud of his Croſſe) by him to reconcile all things unto himſelf: by him (I ſay) whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven. And you that were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alienated, and enemies in your minde by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled, in the bodie of his fleſh through death, to preſent you holy and unblameable, and unreproveable in his ſight,</hi> Coloſ. 1. 19, 20, 21, 22.</p>
               <p>Now, whoſoever hath been formerly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of that great emnity, that was between <hi>God</hi> on the one part: And his own corrupt
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:123675:184"/> ſinfull nature, and converſation on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part. And is now fully ſatisfied, and aſſured by a lively <hi>faith:</hi> That <hi>God was thus in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them.</hi> As likewiſe the ſame Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5. 19. That Soul, I ſay, may confidently boaſt: that ſhe injoyes a ſafe and ſolid <hi>peace:</hi> For that ſhe is joyned unto the <hi>Lord of Hoſts</hi> in an offenſive, and defenſive league. And is thereby impowred, both to <hi>fight the good fight of faith, and ſo to lay hold on eternal life,</hi> as at 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 12.</p>
               <p>And alſo to <hi>reſiſt the Devil, and to make him flee,</hi> as <hi>James</hi> 4. 7. By which we may perceive that this true peace conſiſteth not in an abſolute freedom from war: but in the aſſurance of <hi>Gods</hi> Almighty favour and protection. <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe minde is ſtayed on thee; becauſe he truſteth in thee,</hi> ſaith that Prophet unto the <hi>Lord,</hi> Iſa. 26. 3.</p>
               <p>Not ſuch a perfect peace, as feeleth no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption: but ſuch a perfect peace, as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no diſſolution. <hi>He ſhall not be moved for ever,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 6.</p>
               <p>He may be moved by ſome violent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter: But it will not be long, before he returneth unto his reſting place. Doubtleſſe,
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:123675:185"/> it maketh much for <hi>Gods</hi> glory to exerciſe his Souldiers in a continual warfare: That ſo he may <hi>make bare his own holy arm in the eyes of all the Nations: and that all the ends of the earth may ſee the ſalvation of our God,</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52. 10. Verily the godly, nor are, nor ever ſhall be without adverſaries.</p>
               <p>Neither do they <hi>wreſtle onely againſt fleſh and bloud, but againſt principalities, againſt powers, againſt the rulers of the darkneſſe of this world, againſt ſpiritual wickedneſſe in high places: wherefore they take unto them the whole armour of God, that they may be able to withſtand in the evil day,</hi> according to Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s direction, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 12, 13.</p>
               <p>And in truth, the ſervant of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is ſtill more doubtfull of ſome inteſtine treachery, then of any forraign invaſion: And therefore he <hi>keepeth his heart with all diligence,</hi> according to that word of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 23. He placeth a ſtrong cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury in that center. And for his outworks: <hi>He walketh righteouſly, and ſpeaketh uprightly, he deſpiſeth the gain of oppreſſions, and ſhaketh his hands from holding of bribes, he ſtoppeth his ears from hearing of bloud, and ſhutteth his eyes from ſeeing evil:</hi> according to thoſe ſafe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33. 15.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>he ſhall dwell on high, his</hi>
                  <pb n="353" facs="tcp:123675:185"/> 
                  <hi>place of defence ſhall be the munitions of rocks, bread ſhall be given him, his waters ſhall be ſure. His eye ſhall ſee the King in his beauty, they ſhall behold the land that is very far off,</hi> verſe 16. 17.</p>
               <p>Briefly thus: He ſhall reſt ſecurely, and fare ſufficiently: He ſhall ſee the King in his Majeſty, and travail ſafely under his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>And in every conflict he is ſure of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: <hi>I can do all things through Chriſt, which ſtrenghteneth me,</hi> ſaith he with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 4. 13.</p>
               <p>And therefore with the Prophet <hi>David</hi> he likewiſe concludeth: ſaying, <hi>I will love the Lord my ſtrength: The Lord is my Rock, and my fortreſſe, and my deliverer; my God, my ſtrength in whom I will truſt, my buckler, and the horn of my ſalvation, and my high Tower,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 1. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This is the godly mans garriſon, and it is invincible: And in this confidence. <hi>I will both lay me down in peace, and ſleep,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>for thou Lord onely makeſt me dwell in ſafety,</hi> as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 8.</p>
               <p>This indeed is a ſafe <hi>peace:</hi> Such a <hi>peace,</hi> as paſſeth all underſtanding: And he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to our <hi>Saviours</hi> guard: <hi>For he ſhall keep our hearts and mindes through Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:123675:186"/> Philip. 4. 7. And where this <hi>peace</hi> is quartered, he provides to entertain his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant partner <hi>joy:</hi> This is a compleat Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier, whoſe office moſt properly proclaims his <hi>Prince</hi> his preſence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 11.</p>
               <p>But being of that frolick diſpoſition, he is much miſtaken, and as much abuſed, by ſome that ſeem to be his fellow ſervants: For you ſhall hardly meet with one in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but is deceived in this particular; which we ſhall very eaſily maintain, when we ſhall finde, there are five ſorts of joy, whereof the firſt is a curſed <hi>joy:</hi> The ſecond is a counterfeit <hi>joy:</hi> The third is a careleſſe <hi>joy:</hi> The fourth is a carnal <hi>joy:</hi> And the fifth is a compleat <hi>joy.</hi> The firſt, I ſay, is a curſed <hi>joy.</hi> And this is when a man rejoyceth in any evil, either againſt <hi>God,</hi> or his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour: <hi>Their Soul delighteth in their abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Lord,</hi> Iſa. 66. 3. Every ſin hath ſome ſweetneſſe, wherewith it delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Souls of the wicked: And the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, who is a ſtrict obſerver of all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is thereby ſo well acquainted with our ſeveral inclinations, that he will hardly loſe his opportunity, to preſent us with ſuch ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual objects, and ſuch ſuteable aſſiſtants, as will moſt eaſily allure us, and as eaſily carry us on to a curſed concluſion.</p>
               <pb n="355" facs="tcp:123675:186"/>
               <p> If <hi>Abſalom</hi> delighteth in ambition, and will aſcend thereunto by an unnatural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracie: he ſhall neither want for councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, nor confederates, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Ahab</hi> delighteth in the commodiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his Neighbours inheritance: he ſhall not want for the furtherance of a bloudy wife, of falſe witneſſes, or of corrupt Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, as 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Judas</hi> delighteth in covetouſneſſe, he ſhall have a bribe to betray his Maſter, and the malicious chief Prieſts, &amp; Captains ſhall be as glad to give him money, as he is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Or if <hi>Herod</hi> delighteth in vain-glory, he ſhall have enough to cry him up, <hi>Acts</hi> 12. 22.</p>
               <p>All theſe, together with many others, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto their ſeveral purpoſes and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures: I cannot ſay that they injoyed them (though they rejoyced in them) For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall they verified <hi>Zophars</hi> proverb: <hi>The triumphing of the wicked is ſhort, and the joy of the Hypocrite, but for a moment,</hi> Job 20. 5.

               <p>And <hi>Job</hi> will proteſt againſt <hi>rejoicing at the deſtruction of them that hated him,</hi> Job 31. 29.</p>
               <p>It is a hard matter to perſwade ſcorners, not to delight in ſcorning, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 22.</p>
               <p>And evil men, not to rejoyce to do evil, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 14.</p>
               <p>And fools, not to make it their ſport to do miſchief, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 23.</p>
               <p>But theſe are infallible ſigns: That <hi>they do not joy in God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we have received the atonement:</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the practice of the Saints, Rom. 5. 11.</p>
               <p>And ſo conſequently they do not love the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> And <hi>if any man love not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Maranatha.</hi> Let him be accurſed, or had in execration, even unto the death, ſaith the holy <hi>Ghoſt</hi> by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 16. 22.</p>
               <pb n="357" facs="tcp:123675:187"/>
               <p> The ſecond is a counterfeit <hi>joy:</hi> And this is, when a man ſeemeth outwardly to be merry: whereas inwardly, and in truth his heart is ſorrowfull. This is to put a good face upon a bad caſe. To <hi>ſing ſongs to a heavy heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> Prov. 25. 20.</p>
               <p>And in another place, he compareth the fained laughter of a fool, to the crackling of thorns under a pot: where the noiſe is more offenſive, then the heat is beneficial, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</hi> 7. 6.</p>
               <p>Sometimes this counterfeit mirth is very hurtfull, and injurious unto others: For <hi>as a mad man, who caſteth fire-brands, arrows, and death. So is the man that deceiveth his Neighbour, and ſaith, Am not I in ſport? Prov.</hi> 26. 18, 19. Sometimes it is more hurtfull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our ſelves: For it contradicteth the cry of an accuſing conſcience, which otherwiſe might happily perſwade us to a godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, working repentance unto ſalvation not to be repented of, like that in St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 10.</p>
               <p>But at the beſt, it is both prepoſterous in the uſe, and uncomfortable in the end. <hi>For even in laughter the heart is ſorrowfull; and the end of that mirth is heavineſſe,</hi> Pro. 14. 13. The third is a careleſſe joy, when a man will rejoyce at every trifle: when a man <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth</hi>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:123675:188"/> 
                  <hi>in a thing of nought,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 13. <hi>Yea, folly is joy to him, that is deſtitute of wiſdom,</hi> ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 21. Of this ſort are they, that will be merry meerly for company ſake: but nothing according to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 15. For albeit, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, with all that rejoyce: yet they will not weep with any that weep. Neither will they rejoyce, either with godly men, or in a godly matter, or after a godly manner: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto <hi>Pauls</hi> intention. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may ſay with St. <hi>James: All ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing is evil,</hi> Ja. 4. 16.</p>
               <p>And as it is evil, ſo it is alſo unſafe. <hi>They take the Timbril and Harp, and rejoyce at the ſound of the Organ: They ſpend their dayes in mirth, and in a moment go down to the grave, Job</hi> 21. 12, 13. They die in the midſt of their jollity: And whither then? Verily to judgement: <hi>Rejoyce, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the dayes of thy youth, and walk in the wayes of thine heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all theſe things, God will bring thee into judgement,</hi> Eccleſ. 11. 9.</p>
               <p>Yet this is but the beginning of ſorrows. <hi>The Harp, and Viol, the Tabret, and Pipe, and wine are in their feaſts: but they regard not</hi>
                  <pb n="359" facs="tcp:123675:188"/> 
                  <hi>the work of the Lord, neither conſider the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his hands,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 12.</p>
               <p>There is their careleſſe mirth. <hi>Therefore Hell hath inlarged her ſelf, and opened her mouth without meaſure: and their glorie, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoyceth ſhall deſcend into it,</hi> verſe 14.</p>
               <p>There is their endleſſe miſery.</p>
               <p>The fourth is a carnal joy: As when a man rejoyceth, or taketh delight in ſuch things, as are meerly carnal: ſuch things as are altogether pleaſing to the fleſh, and no leſſe diſpleaſing unto <hi>God.</hi> Such are all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, luſtfull, idle, envious, malitious, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious, treacherous, covetous, proud, or blaſphemous thoughts. All flattering, fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, filthy, lewd, lying, prophane, prejuditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or provoking words. Together with all ungodly, unjuſt, injurious, uncharitable and diſhoneſt actions.</p>
               <p>And whoſoever delighteth in theſe, or in any one of theſe: it is evident that his <hi>joy</hi> is carnal, ſenſual, and ſinfull.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this carnal <hi>joy</hi> doth manifeſt it ſelf by rejoycing carnally, and ſenſually in things that are otherwiſe indifferent, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſefull, and beneficial for the managing or carrying on the affairs of this life. As
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:123675:189"/> when the wiſe man glorieth or rejoyceth in his wiſdom, the mighty man in his might: or the rich man in his riches, or the like, which <hi>God</hi> forbiddeth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 23. Thus great <hi>Goliath</hi> boaſted in his ſtrength, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. 10. <hi>Benhadad</hi> of his forces, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20. 10. <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhakeh</hi> of his victories, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18. 35. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan</hi> of his advancement, <hi>Eſther</hi> 5. 11. The <hi>Phariſee</hi> of his works, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 22. And <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> of his power, <hi>John</hi> 19. 10. And in all theſe the words of <hi>James</hi> were verified: <hi>They rejoyced in their boaſtings, all ſuch rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing is evill,</hi> James 4. 16.</p>
               <p>And thirdly it is by this carnall <hi>joy</hi> that we rejoyce in ſpirituall things after a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal manner: or to the ſatisfying of the fleſh by any preſent of future commodity or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment whatſoever.</p>
               <p>As for example, when we do delight to profeſſe religion: to hear <hi>Gods</hi> holy word; or to partake in any other of his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, either for cuſtom, curioſity, lucre, or pride, preferment or vain-glory.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſſe it was in reference to theſe, or ſome of theſe: or the like indirect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, or purpoſes: That <hi>Herod heard John gladly,</hi> Mar. 6. 20. And ſoon after command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be beheaded, <hi>verſe</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>And that the <hi>Jewes were willing for a</hi>

                  <hi>ſeaſon to rejoyce in his light,</hi> John 5. 35.</p>
               <p>And yet walked in darkneſſe, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and unbelief nevertheleſſe, <hi>verſe</hi> 37. 28.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Simon</hi> the ſorcerer <hi>would have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed the gift of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 8. 13.</p>
               <p>And was therefore reproved for an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, <hi>verſe</hi> 21. And that ſuch hearers, as our <hi>Lord</hi> reſembleth to the ſeed that fell upon the rock: receive the word with joy, and in time of temptation do fall away, <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 13.</p>
               <p>Verily, it were much to be deſired, that all ſuch falſe time-ſervers, and ſelf-ſervers were ſeparated now from <hi>Gods</hi> true ſaints: that ſo we might diſcover, love, and honour the <hi>Lords</hi> true Members with a ſafer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians: let us not deceive our ſelves, whoſoever delighteth in any ſuch thoughts, words, or works, as are meerly carnal, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in common, or indifferent good things ſenſually, or carnally, or in ſpiritual things in order unto theſe, or any of theſe, foreſaid, or any the like carnall ends, or purpoſes: I ſay his <hi>joy</hi> is carnal, or hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical, For theſe are the abortives, the unſeaſonable, and unſanctified conceptions of a carnal minde: And therefore contrary to the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="362" facs="tcp:123675:190"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>For to be carnally minded is death, Becauſe the carnall minde is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the law of God neither indeed can be,</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 6. 7.</p>
               <p>But the fift is a compleat <hi>joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is always in our <hi>Saviours</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. <hi>In his preſence is fulneſſe of joy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 11. And truly this moſt happy kinde of <hi>joy,</hi> is not ſo much external or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream; as it is both internal, and eternal.</p>
               <p>For albeit, <hi>A merry heart maketh a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full countenance,</hi> as ſaith the wiſe man, <hi>Pro.</hi> 15. 13.</p>
               <p>And the Prophet <hi>David</hi> exhorteth all lands, <hi>To make a joyfull noiſe unto the Lord, to ſerve him with gladneſſe, and to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his preſence with ſinging,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>Yet theſe joyful expreſſions are but the indices or evidences of a more joyful heart, For this true chriſtian <hi>joy</hi> is mainly ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and effectual: very anſwerable unto the fountain from whence it proceedeth, and the Object upon which it is placed, and both theſe are the ſame <hi>God in Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For whoſoever can derive his <hi>joy</hi> from <hi>God in Chriſt</hi> reconciling the world unto himſelf: he is likewiſe able to place his <hi>joy</hi> upon <hi>God in Chriſt:</hi> and rateably upon all thoſe Goſpel mercies, which as <hi>mediatour</hi>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:123675:190"/> he hath procured, and purchaſed for the ſons of men.</p>
               <p>And theſe Goſpel mercies are of two ſorts; firſt, ſuch as are ſpiritual in nature; and ſecondly, ſuch as are ſpirituallized by grace.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Goſpel mercies which are ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in their own nature: are ſuch, as are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and evidenced, and ſealed unto us by the <hi>Spirit of God:</hi> And which we do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, imbrace, and apply, and rely upon ſpiritually by <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe that are ſpirituallized by grace; are ſuch as are common to all mankinde, upon the account of a generall diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or diſtribution: But are received, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, and imployed, onely by the children of <hi>God</hi> after a ſpiritual manner. And all theſe mercies, whether they be ſpiritual, or ſpirituallized, are to be rejoyced in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually: According to the exhortations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, and incouragements of our bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> and his dear ſaints, by the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his moſt holy <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt ſpiritual mercy, which is alſo the firſt Object of a chriſtians <hi>joy,</hi> is our <hi>Election.</hi> This our <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rd Jeſus Chriſt</hi> exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to rejoyce in: <hi>Rejoyce not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the ſpirits are ſubject unto you: but rather</hi>
                  <pb n="364" facs="tcp:123675:191"/> 
                  <hi>rejoyce becauſe your names are written in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> Luke 10. 20.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is our <hi>Redemption: Look up, and lift up your heads: for your redemption draweth nigh,</hi> ſaith our <hi>Redeemer</hi> himſelf, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 28.</p>
               <p>This is celebrated with a new ſong by all <hi>Gods elect,</hi> both under the old, and new Teſtaments, <hi>as</hi> Reve. 5. 8, 9. The third is our effectual calling and converſion, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by our true Repentance: For which, <hi>If there be joy in heaven,</hi> as, Luke 15. 7.</p>
               <p>How much more ought we alſo to rejoyce on earth, who do continually injoy the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereof. The fourth is our <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Be of good cheer, thy ſins be forgiven thee,</hi> ſaith our <hi>Saviour</hi> to the man ſick of the palſie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. 2. This was the matter of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> triumph, <hi>who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is God that juſtifieth who is he that condemneth, it is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34.</p>
               <p>And in another place, <hi>O death where is thy ſting? O grave where is thy victory? The ſting of death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the law. But thanks be to God, who hath given us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:123675:191"/> 1 Cor. 15. 55, 56, 57. Who hath given us the victory: by juſtifying us both againſt ſin, and the law. The fifth Object of our <hi>joy</hi> is our <hi>ſanctification, Let thy ſaints rejoyce in goodneſſe,</hi> This was part of <hi>Solomons</hi> prayer. And it was <hi>Pauls</hi> profeſſion: <hi>our rejoycing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is this, the teſtimony of our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that in ſimplicity, and godly ſincerity, not with fleſhly wiſdom but by the grace of God, we have had our converſation in the world,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12.</p>
               <p>The ſixth is our <hi>Salvation,</hi> This was the matter of good <hi>Hannas</hi> joy. And <hi>Hanna pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſaid, my heart rejoyceth in the Lord, mine horn is exalted in the Lord: my mouth is inlarged over mine enemies: becauſe I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in thy ſalvation,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 1.</p>
               <p>And of <hi>Davids</hi> rejoycing, <hi>I will rejoyce in thy ſalvation,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9. 14.</p>
               <p>And thus do all the godly in all ages, <hi>with joy draw water out of the wels of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> Iſa. 12. 3. The ſeventh Goſpel mercy that we are to rejoyce in is <hi>Gods Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: I was glad when they ſaid unto me, let us go into the houſe ef the Lord,</hi> ſaith holy <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2. 1. And wherefore ſhould <hi>David</hi> go into the houſe of the <hi>Lord,</hi> but to partake of his <hi>Ordinances?</hi> But principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are to rejoyce in the <hi>word of God:</hi>
                  <pb n="366" facs="tcp:123675:192"/> the voice of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his Goſpel. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Son of God,</hi> John 15. 11. The eighth is the faithful <hi>miniſtery,</hi> together with the lawful portions thereunto belonging.</p>
               <p>For thus the <hi>Jews</hi> whom <hi>God</hi> had made to rejoyce with great joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nehe. 12. 43. <hi>At that time were ſome appointed over the chambers for the treaſures, for the offerings, for the firſt fruits, and for the tythes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities, the portions of the law</hi> (or appointed by the law) <hi>for the Prieſts, and Levites: For Judah rejoyced for the Prieſts, and for the Levites that waited,</hi> verſe 44.</p>
               <p>But eſpecially the <hi>Miniſtery of the Goſpel</hi> is to be rejoyced in, <hi>As it is written: How beautifull are the feet of them that preach the Goſpel of peace, and bring glad tidings of good things,</hi> Rom. 10. 15.</p>
               <p>And the ninth ſpiritual bleſſing is faith, by which we are inabled to believe, that theſe, And all other Goſpel mercies are trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up for us, and given out unto us, in, and by our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt: whom having not ſeen, ye love, in whom though now ye ſee him not, yet believing ye rejoyce with joy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> ſaith that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
               <pb n="367" facs="tcp:123675:192"/>
               <p> And St. <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth. <hi>Now the God of all hope</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>fill you with all joy and peace in believing,</hi> Rom. 15. 13. Theſe are ſuch Goſpel mercies as are principally ſpiritual. For they are either the aſſiſtants, or the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance or the ſubſtance of our ſpiritual and eternall happineſſe: And therefore much to be rejoyced in. Thoſe that are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituallized, are ſuch things, as are common in their own nature, and do more eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern, the pilgrimage of this our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, as being the providences, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions pertaining thereunto. And they may all be referred unto theſe two generall heads: Namely <hi>Proſperity,</hi> and <hi>Adverſity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are the two large arms of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: with our <hi>God</hi> ſtretcheth over all his creatures. And in both theſe the righteous man rejoyceth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, his joy is more general: As when the Object thereof is the proſperity of <hi>Gods Church,</hi> according to that ſweet incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Rejoyce ye with Jeruſalem, and be glad with her, all ye that love her, rejoyce for joy with her all ye that mourn for her: that ye may ſuck, and be ſatisfied with the breaſts of her conſolation: that ye may milk out, and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the abundance of her glory,</hi> Iſa. 66. 10, 11.</p>
               <pb n="368" facs="tcp:123675:193"/>
               <p> Secondly, the <hi>joy</hi> of the godly is more particular, as when it reflecteth upon thoſe things, that do more properly conduce to their own private proſperity. Such are their preſervations and deliverances: <hi>I will be glad, and rejoyce in thy mercy; for thou haſt conſidered my trouble, thou haſt known my ſoul in adverſities: Thou haſt not ſhut me up in the hand of the enemy: thou haſt ſet my feet in a large room,</hi> ſaith the Prophet <hi>David</hi> unto the <hi>Lord,</hi> Pſal. 31. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>And in the 32 <hi>Pſalm</hi> verſe 7. <hi>Thou art my hiding place, thou ſhalt preſerve me from trouble: thou ſhalt compaſſe me about with ſongs of deliverance,</hi> ſaith the ſame ſweet ſinger of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Secondly the ſuccesfull return of their prayers is the cauſe of their joy or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing. <hi>Ask, and ye ſhall receive, that your joy may be full,</hi> ſaith our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour,</hi> John 16. 24.</p>
               <p>But we have yet more particular, and preſent Objects of our <hi>joy.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>As firſt our wives, <hi>live joyfully with the wife, whom thou loveſt, all the dayes of the life of thy vanity,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Preacher,</hi> Eccl. 9. 9.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, our children: <hi>Thus Sara rejoyced in the child, that God had given her,</hi> Gen. 21. 6.</item>
                  <item>Thirly, our families, and friends, and all the good gifts of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <pb n="369" facs="tcp:123675:193"/>
               <p> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhult rejoyce in every good thing, which the Lord thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine houſe, thou and the Levite, and the ſtranger that is among you,</hi> Deut. 26. 11.</p>
               <p>But you will ſay, do not all men rejoyce in theſe neceſſary, and convenient comforts of this life? The Reprobate as well as the Righteous? They do indeed, but their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections differ, as much as their profeſſion, or their practice. The natural mans joy ſpends it ſelf upon ſome ſuppoſed excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the Creatures: As their uſefulneſſe, their beauty, their bravery, their pleaſure, profit, preferment, or the like carnal cauſe of commendations. <hi>Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the houſe of the Kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honour of my Majeſtie,</hi> ſaith King <hi>Nebuchad-nezzar, Dan.</hi> 4. 30. But they do not rejoyce in them as they are Goſpel mercies, gifts of grace, for they ſcorne to own them as anothers purchace: and they will have, &amp; hold them, and deſire no favour.</p>
               <p>But the ſpiritual man rejoyceth not ſo much in the goodneſſe of the Creature, as in the goodneſſe of the <hi>Creator:</hi> Not in the gift, but in the <hi>giver.</hi> He deriveth his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in all good things, from the juſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace of his <hi>Lord,</hi> and <hi>Maſter:</hi> He owns
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:123675:194"/> them as the bleſſings of his <hi>God,</hi> and pledges of more large and laſting favours. And he is carefull to diſpoſe them to the glory of his <hi>Patron,</hi> and <hi>Protectour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſees his <hi>God</hi> in all that he injoyes, and ſo commends them to his gratefull Soul, as Goſpel mercies ſpiritualliz'd by grace. But yet this ſpiritual <hi>joy</hi> is not compleat, unleſſe it ſmiles upon adverſity.</p>
               <p>What (ſaith <hi>Job) ſhall we receive good at the hand of God, and ſhall we not receive evil? Job</hi> 2. 10. Or ſhall we rejoyce in proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty onely, and ſhall we not rejoyce in adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity alſo? Shall we bewayl <hi>Gods</hi> fatherly corrections? Then ſurely 'tis for want of exerciſe. <hi>No chaſtening for the preſent ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be joyons, but grievous: nevertheleſſe, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe to them that are exerciſed thereby, Hebr.</hi> 12. 11.</p>
               <p>Verily, it is <hi>Gods</hi> good pleaſure to keep his Saints in the continual exerciſe of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, that ſo they may be able to run, and not be weary, and walk, and not faint, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40. 31. Thus he dealt with <hi>Paul,</hi> and the reſt of his Apoſtles: Till <hi>Paul</hi> was able to <hi>take pleaſure in infirmities, in reproches, in ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, in perſecutions, in diſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 10.</p>
               <pb n="371" facs="tcp:123675:194"/>
               <p> And other of the Apoſtles to rejoyce: <hi>That they were counted worthie to ſuffer ſhame for the name of Chriſt,</hi> Acts 5. 41.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore, my brethren, count it all joy, when ye fall into divers temptations,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ja.</hi> 1. 2. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter. Beloved, think it not ſtrange concerning the fierie tryal which is to trie you, as though ſome ſtrange thing hapned unto you: But rejoice, in as much as ye are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of Chriſts ſufferings: that when his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſhall be revealed, ye may be glad alſo with exceeding joy,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 12, 13. And thus the Saints afflictions become the objects of their <hi>joy,</hi> as Goſpel mercies. And through theſe paſſages their <hi>joy</hi> becometh a joy unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and full of glory, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. And not a compleat, or a full joy onely: but <hi>fulneſſe of joy,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. 11. Theſe ſix at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants ordinarily live in the preſence of our Lord Chriſt Jeſus: New <hi>Life,</hi> true <hi>Light,</hi> and ſound <hi>Humility,</hi> Goſpel <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> ſafe <hi>Peace,</hi> compleat <hi>Joy.</hi> Which, when the Soul deliberately findeth, ſhe is confirmed, ſhe hath found her <hi>Lord.</hi>

                  <hi>True</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Lord) thou haſt made me to ſerve with thy ſins, thou haſt wearied me with thine iniquities: But I, even I am he that blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins,</hi> Iſa. 43. 24, 25.

               <p>
                  <hi>I lay down my life for the ſheep,</hi> ſaith our good <hi>ſhepheard,</hi> John 10. 15. <hi>No man taketh</hi>

               <p>And <hi>greater love hath no man then this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,</hi> Jo. 15. 13.</p>
               <p>Moſt true it is, no man hath greater love: But our dear <hi>Lord,</hi> both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> hath greater; for he did lay down his life for his enemies: <hi>when we were enemies, we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God by the death of his ſon,</hi> Rom. 5. 10.</p>
               <p>Theſe are excellent arguments of his more excellent affection. Yet to confirm her faith beyond all ſcruple, ſhe will examine ſome of his chief witneſſes. And firſt St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who teſtifieth, that our <hi>Lord</hi> hath purchaſed his ſpouſe with his own bloud.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take heed therefore unto your ſelves</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and unto the whole flock, over the which the holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own bloud,</hi> Acts 20. 28.</p>
               <p>Again, <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us,</hi> Gal. 3. 13. <hi>And ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But with the precious bloud of Chriſt, as of a lamb without blemiſh, and without ſpot,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 18. &amp;c. <hi>his own ſelf bare our ſins</hi>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:123675:196"/> 
                  <hi>in his own bodie on the Tree, that we being dead to ſin, ſhould live unto righteouſneſſe: by whoſe ſtripes we are healed,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, 1 Pet. 2. 24. <hi>Now hereby perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us,</hi> ſaith that beloved Diſciple, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 16.</p>
               <p>And therefore <hi>unto him that hath loved us, and waſhed us from our ſins in his own bloud, and hath made us Kings and Prieſts unto God and his father, to him be glorie and dominion for ever and ever, amen,</hi> Rev. 1. 5, 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Scarcely for a righteous man will one die,</hi> ſaith our Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 7.</p>
               <p>But that the onely begotten <hi>Son of God,</hi> whom he hath made Heir of all things ſhould die a curſed death, to redeem the foul Souls of filthy deſpicable ſinners. Hear, O Heavens! and be aſtoniſhed, O earth! This is an unconceiveable love, a bottomleſſe affection.</p>
               <p>But now the Soul, having peruſed his promiſes, conſidered his performances, and examined his witneſſes, till ſhe is well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in this truth. In the next place, ſhe asks to what intent did <hi>Chriſt</hi> redeem us at ſo deer a rate? And learned <hi>Paul</hi> informs her, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. <hi>Husbands love your wives</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>even as Chriſt alſo loved the Church, and gave himſelf for it, that he might ſanctifie and</hi>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:123675:197"/> 
                  <hi>cleanſe it with the waſhing of water by the word. That he might preſent it to himſelf a glorious Church, not having ſpot, or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing, but that it ſhould be holy, and without blemiſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 25, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But can ſo great a <hi>Lord</hi> vouchſafe ſuch grace, as to betroth, or marry to himſelf ſuch wretched, weak, and undeſerving crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? As <hi>Paul</hi> in that place ſeems to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate. This is the ſecond queſtion, in which the Soul deſireth to be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>And thereupon ſhe runs to his Records, and there, by his aſſiſtance, findes it written. <hi>I will betroth thee unto me for ever,</hi> Hoſea 2. 19. And by his Prophet <hi>Jeremy. Turn, O back-ſliding Children, for I am married unto you, Jer.</hi> 3. 14. Having conſidered theſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies: Then from his word ſhe frames ſuch arguments as may confirm her in this bleſſed truth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, it appeareth, that the <hi>Lord</hi> doth marry his Church unto himſelf: In that he ealleth her his <hi>ſpouſe,</hi> Cant. 4. 8. <hi>Come with me from Lebanon my ſpouſe.</hi> And in the four next enſuing verſes of that Chapter, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolleth her beauty, her affection, her profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and her ehaſtity: four ſeveral times under the title of his ſpouſe, his ſiſter, his ſpouſe.</p>
               <pb n="377" facs="tcp:123675:197"/>
               <p> His ſiſter, in regard that he had taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf her fleſh: And his ſpouſe, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that he had joyned her unto himſelf in the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it is evident that the <hi>Lord</hi> marrieth his church unto himſelf. For that he will have her call him husband, <hi>Thou ſhalt call me Iſhi:</hi> that is in the Originall my <hi>husband,</hi> and ſhalt call me no more <hi>Baali:</hi> that is my <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he to his church of the <hi>Jews,</hi> Hoſ. 2. 16.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is plain that the <hi>Lord</hi> marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his church unto himſelf. In regard that he calleth himſelf her husband, and her his wife, <hi>Thy maker is thy husband (the Lord of hoſts is his name) and thy Redeemer the holy one of Iſrael, the God of the whole earth ſhall he be called. For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forſaken, and grieved in ſpirit, and a wife of youth,</hi> Iſa. 54. 5. 6.</p>
               <p>And fourthly, it is manifeſt that he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth his church unto himſelf: In reſpect that he will have her called after his own name, we finde, that his holy <hi>Spirit</hi> direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to call him by the name of: <hi>The Lord our righteouſneſſe,</hi> Jere. 23. 6. And this is the name wherewith ſhe ſhall be called: <hi>The Lord our righteouſneſſe,</hi> ſaith the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> by the ſame Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 16.</p>
               <pb n="378" facs="tcp:123675:198"/>
               <p> And in that it is ſaid, this is the name wherewith ſhe <hi>ſhall</hi> be called: it is evident, that ſhe was not ſo called formerly. And we know, that there is no ingagement, no relation whatſoever, that can make a woman capable of any other name, then what ſhe formerly had, but that of marriage onely.</p>
               <p>Again the ſoul demands this queſtion, How is it, that our gracious <hi>Lord</hi> vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth ſo great an honour to his church, to own her according to that high degree of marriage? And after ſome expoſtulation, ſhe thus reſolves her ſelf. Surely it is to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence unto us that intire Union, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding nearneſſe, that is between the <hi>Spirit</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and the dear ſouls of his beloved ſaints. There is a near relation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong countrymen and kindred.</p>
               <p>Inſomuch that <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſed, he could <hi>wiſh himſelf accurſed for his kinſmen accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 9. 3.</p>
               <p>Yet we ſee they little deſerved it at his hands, <hi>Acts</hi> 24. 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some what more near then that is the relation among brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behold how good and how pleaſant it is bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to dwell together in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, ſaith David,</hi> Pſal. 133. 1. Yet we finde that <hi>Cain</hi> killed his brother <hi>Abel,</hi> Gen. 4. 8. And <hi>Eſau</hi> intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the like to his brother <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 27. 41.</p>
               <pb n="379" facs="tcp:123675:198"/>
               <p> There is alſo a near ingagement among friends, <hi>A friend ſticketh cloſer then a brother,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> Prov. 18. 24.</p>
               <p>Yet, we know, that there is falſhood in friendſhip, <hi>Joab</hi> ſlew his great friend <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom,</hi> 2 Sam. 18. 14.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Judas</hi> abuſed that ſweet attribute moſt baſely, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 50.</p>
               <p>But very ſtrict and very binding are thoſe Obligations between the parents and their children, <hi>lo, children are an heritage of the Lord: and the fruit of the womb is his reward. As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man, ſo are children of the youth, Happy is the man, that hath his quiver full of them, they ſhall not be aſhamed: but they ſhall ſpeak with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the gate,</hi> Pſal. 127. 3, 4, 5. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Paul, Honour thy father, and thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which is</hi> the <hi>firſt commandment with promiſe)</hi> ſaith he <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 2. Nevertheleſſe our <hi>Lord</hi> acquainteth us, That <hi>the brother ſhall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children ſhall riſe up againſt their parents, and cauſe them to be put to death,</hi> Mat. 10. 21.</p>
               <p>And have not we ſeen, or credibly heard of the like unnatural actions performed in our dayes? <hi>But ſo ought men to love their wives as their own bodies: he that loveth his wife,</hi>
                  <pb n="380" facs="tcp:123675:199"/> 
                  <hi>loveth himſelf: No man ever yet hated his own fleſh: but nouriſheth, and cheriſheth it, even as Chriſt the Church, ſaith Paul,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 28, 29.</p>
               <p>Here indeed is the right cordial relation, that ſtrict and ſtrong Obligation, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhould cancel but death.</p>
               <p>He is not worthy of the name of man, that forſaketh, or abuſeth his own wife.</p>
               <p>No man ever yet hated his own fleſh, but nouriſheth, and cheriſheth it. There is the lovely ſhaddow of a tender compaſſion, even as the <hi>Lord the church.</hi> There is the true ſubſtance of a dear and dureable affection.</p>
               <p>And therefore the main reaſon (as the ſoul conceiveth) why the <hi>Lord</hi> vouchſafeth this moſt acceptable expreſſion of marriage, is to ſhew us that integrity; that exact and abſolute Union and communion that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt himſelf &amp; his church. <hi>He that is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto an harlot, is one body,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 16. Where <hi>Paul</hi> inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that marriage is ſo ſtrict a tie, that the very abuſe thereof is of an uniting quality. <hi>But he that is joyned unto the Lord is one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>verſe</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>Now whatſoever is carnal is mortal, and dubious: but that which is ſpirituall, is eternal and glorious.</p>
               <p>O! ſaith that ſweet and amorous ſoul,
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:123675:199"/> that I were ſure my <hi>Lord</hi> had ſuch a love to me; as that he would eſpouſe me to himſelf, I am perſwaded now, that he hath ſuch a love unto his church in general.</p>
               <p>But how ſhall I appropriate the ſame unto my ſelf: or how may I be ſure, that I ſhall thus in joy my gracious <hi>Lord?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this is the circumſtance wherein the <hi>ſoul</hi> deſireth ſatisfaction. And thereupon ſhe liſtens to St. <hi>Paul, The life which I now live in the fleſh, I live by the faith of the Son of God: who loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gala. 2. 20.</p>
               <p>True, ſaith the tender ſoul, if I were ſuch a choſen veſſel as was good St. <hi>Paul,</hi> I might triumph with the like confidence, yet after ſome debate within her ſelf, ſhe thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies: why what had <hi>Paul,</hi> but what he did receive? Or what made him to differ? was it not my <hi>Lord? with whom there is no reſpect of perſons,</hi> as, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſſe my <hi>God,</hi> who onely can fit me for this preferment, he looketh not upon the man, but his <hi>Mediatour:</hi> he regardeth not the metall, but the ſtamp: the image and ſuperſcription, whoſe is that? Surly if the image of <hi>Chriſt</hi> be graven in me, it makes no matter, either what I am, or how I am
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:123675:200"/> called. <hi>For there is neither Jew, nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for we are all one in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Gala. 3. 28. And as neither nation, nor ſex, nor any outward ſtate or condition, nor any other earthly diſtinction can make a difference in the ſight of <hi>God:</hi> ſo neither can ſin exclude me from his favour. <hi>For God commendeth his love towards us in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 3. 8.</p>
               <p>Theſe things conſidered; the <hi>Soul</hi> begins to be perſwaded, that her <hi>Lord</hi> both may, and will love her, as well as any other. For now ſhe ſees ther's no impediment that can deſtroy, or contradict her hopes.</p>
               <p>Yet ſtill ſhe's ſick of love, nor can her minde receive or cure, or comfort till ſhe meets with ſuch an argument of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards her ſelf in every degree, as is both certain, and infallible. Therefore ſhe cries, and gives her <hi>Lord</hi> no reſt, until he openeth her underſtanding, that ſhe may learn this myſtery of <hi>love.</hi> That never any ſoul did love the <hi>Lord;</hi> but the ſame ſoul was firſt beloved by him. And this muſt needs be ſo for many Reaſons.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe <hi>God</hi> is the onely perfect ſubſtance of true <hi>love, God is love,</hi> ſaith St.

                  <hi>John,</hi> 1 Jo. 4. 16. And therefore we cannot love <hi>God</hi> but by vertue of that love which is eſſentially in <hi>God:</hi> For otherwiſe we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him but a ſhaddow inſtead of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, becauſe <hi>God</hi> is the onely Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour and giver of <hi>love: love is of God,</hi> 1 John 4. 8. And therefore unleſſe <hi>God</hi> doth firſt, in love to us, beſtow his love upon us: we can have no love at all to diſpoſe of, as in relation unto him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe <hi>every one that loveth is born of God,</hi> 1 John 4. 7. And it would be a prepoſterous thing, for the child to love before the <hi>father. Behold what manner of love the father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the ſons of God,</hi> 1 John 3. 1.</p>
               <p>And as it is a far greater argument of love, that we ſhould be made the ſons of <hi>God,</hi> then that we ſhould be called the ſons of <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Fourthly, becauſe <hi>Gods</hi> love to us is the cauſe of our love to <hi>God, we love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> Saith the ſame lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and beloved Diſciple, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 19. Now the cauſe muſt of neceſſity, be before the effect. And therefore unleſſe <hi>God</hi> doth firſt love us efficiently: it is impoſſible that
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:123675:201"/> we ſhould love <hi>God</hi> effectually. And alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to this purpoſe is that in the Prophet <hi>Jeremy. I have loved thee</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Lord) with an everlaſting love, therefore with loving kindneſſe have I drawn thee,</hi> Jer. 31. 3.</p>
               <p>Becauſe the <hi>Lord</hi> did love his Church with an everlaſting love, therefore with loving kindneſſe he did draw her to love him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. For this I humbly conceive to be the moſt proper, and ſuteable end of this attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. It being likewiſe the moſt principal, or onely duty, which the <hi>Lord</hi> requireth, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 5. <hi>and</hi> Math. 22. 37.</p>
               <p>And being thus confirmed in this truth, the willing <hi>Soul</hi> hath nothing elſe to do, to fatisfie her fully in this caſe, but to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſincerity, and goodneſſe of her own <hi>love</hi> to her <hi>Lord.</hi> And thereupon ſhe brings it to the tryal.</p>
               <p>And firſt ſhe findes it eager to injoy. She ſings with that melodious Prophet <hi>David. As the heart panteth after the water brooks, ſo panteth my Soul after thee, O God! My Soul thirſteth for God: for the living God, when ſhall I come to appear before God?</hi> Pſal. 42. 1, 2. And in the 48. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>How amiable are thy Tabernacles, O Lord of Hoſts! My Soul longeth; yea, even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord: my heart, and my fleſh crieth out for the living God.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="385" facs="tcp:123675:201"/>
               <p> Secondly, it is fervent, or ardent in the act of injoying: 'tis no <hi>Laodicean</hi> luke-warm love. It makes the Soul ſay with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſpouſe. <hi>Set me as a Seal upon thine heart, as a Seal upon thine arm: for love is ſtrong as death. Many waters cannot quench love: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the flouds drown it,</hi> Cant. 8. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſhe findes it very generous: It ſoorneth to be baſe, or trivial. Too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to be ſo mercenary, as with thoſe fools to ſay unto the <hi>Lord: Depart from us, and what can the Almighty do for us,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> 22. 17. It makes her ſcorn to ſtand for any wages: That ſhe refers to her beloved's goodneſſe. She knows her wages will be better far, then all her works can any way deſerve. She remembers the <hi>words of her Lord Jeſus, how he ſaid, It is more bleſſed to give, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> as <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 35. And thereupon her love will not be bought at any rate. <hi>If a man would give all the ſubſtance of his houſe for love, it would utterly be contemned,</hi> Cant. 8. 7. Neither will this loving Soul be bribed, but will rather ſay with <hi>Peter. Thy money periſh with thee, becauſe thou haſt thought that the gift of God may be purchaſed with money,</hi> Acts 8. 20.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, it is ſo generous, that it will not be overcome by any baſe, or lewd, or carnal luſt. It will ſay with <hi>Joſeph: How</hi>
                  <pb n="386" facs="tcp:123675:202"/> 
                  <hi>can I do this great wickedneſſe, and ſin againſt God,</hi> Gen. 39. 9.</p>
               <p>And with <hi>Moſes it will chuſe rather to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer affliction with the people of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon,</hi> as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. 25.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is ſo generous, that it will not be daunted, either for fear of loſſe, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, or death it ſelf. According to the example of <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego, Dan.</hi> 3. And of <hi>Daniel</hi> himſelf, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, it is ſo generous, that it ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be nigardly in proſperity: It will buy the truth, and not ſell it, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 23.</p>
               <p>It ſayeth with <hi>David: What ſhall I ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me?</hi> Pſal. 116. 12. And therefore he will not offer burnt-offerings unto the <hi>Lord his God of that which doth coſt him nothing, as</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 24. Yea, with the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> it will give more then <hi>is neceſſary to the work,</hi> as <hi>Exod.</hi> 35. 22. &amp;c. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 36. 5.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, it is ſo generous, that it will not be diſmayed in adverſity. In caſe of deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or reproch it will ſay with <hi>David: I will yet be more vile then thus,</hi> as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 22. In caſe of danger it will ſay with <hi>Peter: Though I ſhould die with thee, yet will I not deny thee,</hi> as <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 35. And in caſe of extremity it
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:123675:202"/> will ſay with <hi>Job. Naked came I out of my Mothers womb, and naked ſhall I return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, bleſſed be the name of the Lord,</hi> Job 1. 21. And with <hi>Paul: None of theſe things move me, neither count I my life deer unto my ſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe with joy, and the Miniſtery, which I have received of the Lord Jeſus to teſtifie the Goſpel of the grace of God,</hi> Acts 20. 24.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, it is ſo generous that it will not ſpare for any expreſſions, nor any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. It will ſtrive to out-ſtrip the ſinfull woman, <hi>who when ſhe knew that Jeſus ſate at meat in the</hi> Phariſees <hi>houſe, brought an Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſter box of oyntment: And ſtood at his feet behinde him, weeping, and began to waſh his feet with tears, and wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kiſſed his feet, and anoynted them with the oytment,</hi> Luke 7. 37, 38. Or what it cannot do to him in his perſon, it will do to him in his Members: when he is an hungry, it will give him meat, when he is thirſty, it will give him drink, when he is a ſtranger, it will take him in: Naked, it will cloath him, Sick, it will viſit him, in Priſon, it will come unto him. For which the <hi>Lord</hi> ſhall ſay unto this Soul: <hi>Verily, in as much as thou haſt done it to one of the leaſt of theſe my</hi>
                  <pb n="388" facs="tcp:123675:203"/> 
                  <hi>brethren, thou haſt done it unto me,</hi> as <hi>Math.</hi> 25. 40.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <p>ANd thus the <hi>Soul,</hi> having examined her love by theſe, and the like properties, and finding it to be ſincere and ſound, her joyfull heart is fully ſatisfied, that now the match between her <hi>Lord</hi> and her, is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely made and finiſhed.</p>
               <p>For as ſhe apprehends his <hi>love</hi> by <hi>faith,</hi> ſo ſhe returns her <hi>love</hi> by <hi>reſolution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>She hears him ſing: That he is overcome, and raviſh't with her beauties, and her love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>And in conſideration thereof, ſhe gives conſent, and ſo confirms the contract. <hi>My beloved is mine, and I am his,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 16. My beloved is mine, or I know that my beloved is mine: There is the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And I am his, or I do freely give my ſelf to be his: There is the conſent. And from theſe deer concluſions they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſolemnize their heavenly nuptials. <hi>He brings her unto the banqueting houſe, and his banner over her is love,</hi> Cant. 2. 4. <hi>And ſhe holds him, and will not let him go, untill ſhe hath brought him into her mothers houſe; and into the Chamber of her, that conceived her, Cant.</hi> 3. 4.</p>
               <pb n="389" facs="tcp:123675:203"/>
               <p> And now he weds, and beds her. <hi>For as the Bride-groom rejoyceth over the Bride: ſo her Lord rejoiceth over her,</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62. 5.</p>
               <p>And the ſweet <hi>Soul</hi> is made ſo ſenſible of her deer <hi>Lords</hi> embraces, that ſhe breaks forth into theſe, &amp; the like ſacred raptures. <hi>A bundle of Myrrhe is my well-beloved unto me: he ſhall lie all night betwixt my breaſts.</hi> As <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me,</hi> Cant. 2. 6.</p>
               <p>And being thus become a married wife, ſhe ſtudies, how ſhe beſt may pleaſe her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. And to that purpoſe ſhe conſulteth not with fleſh and bloud, but with his holy <hi>Spirit:</hi> By whom, ſhe begs, that ſhe may be directed unto the knowledge of his bleſſed will, according to the tenor of his word.</p>
               <p>And firſt, ſhe findes this exhortation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hand of his Apoſtle <hi>Paul. Wives ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord,</hi> Eph. 5. 22. Here is both a rule, and an example. <hi>She ſubmitteth her ſelf therefore unto God:</hi> According to Saint <hi>James</hi> his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, <hi>James</hi> 4. 7.</p>
               <p>Yea, <hi>ſhe ſubmitteth her ſelf to every ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of man for her Lords ſake, whether it be to the King as ſupream, or unto governours, as unto them that are ſent by him, for the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of evil doers, and for the praiſe of them</hi>
                  <pb n="390" facs="tcp:123675:204"/> 
                  <hi>that do well:</hi> According to that of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Peter 2. 13, 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſhe findeth by St. <hi>Peter:</hi> That <hi>wives ought to obey their husbands, even as</hi> Sarah <hi>obeyed</hi> Abraham, 1 Peter 3. 6.</p>
               <p>And thereupon ſhe ſaith unto her <hi>Lord,</hi> as the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſometimes ſaid in the preſence of <hi>Moſes. All that the Lord hath ſaid, I will do, and be obedient,</hi> as <hi>Exod.</hi> 24. 7.</p>
               <p>Yea, ſhe ſaith with the Propher <hi>David: I delight to do thy will, O my God: Yea, thy law is within my heart,</hi> Pſal. 40. 8.</p>
               <p>Yet, leſt ſhe ſhould miſtake in her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts: ſhe oftentimes doth pray with the ſame Prophet: <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O Lord, teach me thy ſtatues,</hi> Pſal. 119. 12. <hi>Make me to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the way of thy precepts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſe</hi> 26. And <hi>teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God,</hi> Pſal. 143. 10. She prayes that ſhe may do, as well as underſtand. And as ſhe prayes, ſo ſhe reſolves to practice. That ſo ſhe may prove <hi>what is that good, that accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble will of God:</hi> According to St. <hi>Paul</hi> his milde requeſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 2. From whom ſhe likewiſe meets with this inſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This is the will of God, even your ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 3. &amp;c. And from St. <hi>Peter</hi> thus: <hi>As he, which hath called you, is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of converſation: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi>
                  <pb n="391" facs="tcp:123675:204"/> 
                  <hi>it is written. Be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 15. 16.</p>
               <p>And therefore in obedience to his will: <hi>She endeavoureth to cleanſe her ſelf from all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe of fleſh and ſpirit: perfecting holineſſe in the fear of God,</hi> as in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1.</p>
               <p>And for as much as ſhe conceives, that ſhe cannot attain to that perfection of holineſſe, that will be requiſite: ſhe calls upon her husband for ſupplies: <hi>Who of God is made unto her wiſdom, and righteouſneſſe, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 30. So that though ſhe be a poor Soul: yet ſhe hath a very rich husband.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſhe findeth, <hi>that the wife muſt ſee, that ſhe reverence her husband,</hi> Eph. 5. 33.</p>
               <p>And therefore this new-married Soul doth ſtrive to raiſe her thoughts above the common rate, and fix them on ſuch venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objects as may provoke to reverence and honour.</p>
               <p>Doth <hi>Majeſtie</hi> require a reverence? <hi>Why with her Lord is terrible Majeſty: Touching the Almighty we cannot finde him out, he is excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in power, and in judgement, and in plenty of juſtice,</hi> Job 37. 22. 23.</p>
               <p>Is <hi>wiſdom</hi> to be had in reverence? <hi>Why in him are hid all the Treaſures of wiſdom, and knowledge,</hi> Col. 2. 3.</p>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:123675:205"/>
               <p> Is it required that we reverence <hi>Age: Why he is the ancient of dayes,</hi> Dan. 7. 9. <hi>The eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God,</hi> Deut. 33. 27.</p>
               <p>Or do we reverence and honour <hi>goodneſſe?</hi> Surely we ought ſo to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Why there is none good but he,</hi> Matth. 10. 17. If theſe, or any other excellencies, are to be reverenced in the Creature, according to their limits, or degrees. By how much more muſt they be honoured, and reverenced in the great <hi>Creator,</hi> where they are match<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, perfect, infinite. Therefore the <hi>Soul</hi> that's married unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> conſidereth his might, his Majeſty, his wiſdom, goodneſſe, and eternity: with all his fulneſſe, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; that ſo ſhe may <hi>have grace, whereby ſhe may ſerve him acceptably, with reverence, and godly fear,</hi> as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. 28.</p>
               <p>And though ſhe is not ſuperſtitious, to place the ſtrength of her devotions in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forms, &amp; bodily performances: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That bodily exerciſe profiteth little,</hi> as 1 Tim. 4. 8.</p>
               <p>And that <hi>God,</hi> being a <hi>Spirit, muſt be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiped in Spirit, and in truth,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> 4. 24.</p>
               <p>Yet neither is ſhe barbarous, or rude, to exerciſe ſuch incivilities, in the partaking of <hi>Gods</hi> Ordinances, as ſhe would fear to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in the preſence of civil perſons, or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties.
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:123675:205"/> We know, there is a reverence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to husbands, fathers, maſters, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, chiefly as they are ſubordinate to <hi>God,</hi> whom they do perſonate, or repreſent: according to their weak proportions. And ſhall we honour theſe imperfect ſhaddowes, more then we honour that moſt perfect ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, for, and by whom, they are made honourable? Do we conceive both cap, and knee too little, wherewith to reverence our ſuperiours, when we do meet them in their ſeveral ſtations? And think we one of theſe to be too much to reverence the great <hi>King</hi> of Kings withall, when we attend him in his Ordinances? There are many in this time of pretended, or inforced, or deſired famine of the <hi>word:</hi> that will go as far to a Sermon; (if they like the Sermoners) as to a Sias, or Seſſions. I do not diſcommend them for that. Yet they will not allow the leaſt reverence to the word of <hi>God</hi> in the Sermon, that they will afford to the word of Man in the Seſſions. I do not commend them for this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in order,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 40.</p>
               <p>We do all ſtrive to ſeem very ſpiritual: <hi>But glorifie God in your bodie, and in your ſpirit, which are Gods,</hi> ſaith the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20.</p>
               <pb n="394" facs="tcp:123675:206"/>
               <p> Glorifie <hi>God</hi> in your body, as well as in your ſpirit: if you will acknowledge, that your body belongeth unto <hi>God.</hi> It is a fault amongſt us, that in matters of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion we do commonly indeavour to make our out-ſides ſeem better, then our inſides really are. But if our inſides be not much better then our out-ſides in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar: we are in nothing ſo good, as we ought to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let the wife ſee, that ſhe reverence her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> ſaith this third rule.</p>
               <p>But if ſhe do not reverence him in her outward actions, as well as in her inward affections: who can <hi>ſee</hi> that ſhe reverenceth him at all, beſides her ſelf?</p>
               <p>We proceed to the fourth rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let every woman have her own husband,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 2.</p>
               <p>The Soul that's married unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> muſt have none other husband, but <hi>Chriſt:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe will not ſuffer her affections to run out towards her old acquaintance, her old ſuter <hi>ſin. For ſhe reckons her ſelf to be dead indeed unto ſin: being alive unto God, through Jeſus Chriſt her Lord,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 11.</p>
               <p>And therefore ſhe will <hi>love her Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity,</hi> as <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 24.</p>
               <p>That ſo in every caſe of dread, or danger:
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:123675:206"/> She may indear him with good <hi>Hezekiah, I beſeech thee O Lord, remember, how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart,</hi> 1 Kings 20. 3.</p>
               <p>The fift Rule is this, <hi>let not the wife de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from her husband,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 10.</p>
               <p>And therefore when the <hi>Soul</hi> is truely wedded to her dear husband <hi>Chriſt:</hi> the fleſh, the Devil, the world, with all their provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, aſſaults, allurements, and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can neither draw nor drive her, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, or flee away from her beloved <hi>Lord:</hi> they cannot make her ſuch a wicked harlot, as to <hi>forſake the guide of her youth: and to forget the covenant of her God, like</hi> that ſtrange woman, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 17.</p>
               <p>They peradventure may ſo over-power her, that they may force her accidentally to ſlip aſide, or ſlide a little back. But ſhe remembereth immediately that gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation of her <hi>Lord, Turn O back-ſliding children: for I am married unto you,</hi> Jer. 3. 14.</p>
               <p>Together with that excellent aſſurance, <hi>I will heal thy back-ſlidings, and will love thee freely,</hi> Hoſea 14. 4. And thereupon ſhe makes a quick return, ſhe humbly ſues unto her <hi>Lord</hi> for pardon: which ſhe through <hi>faith</hi> obtaineth, and by <hi>love</hi> renews her covenant, and ſo reſolves to walk more wiſely for the time to come.</p>

               <p>And therefore ſuch a <hi>love,</hi> as will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and fit to carry on a godly work, muſt have <hi>God</hi> for its object, and <hi>Gods</hi> glorie for its end. More plainly thus: If we will la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in a work by <hi>love,</hi> ſo as to bring it to a godly frame: Our <hi>love</hi> muſt be ſincere to <hi>God in Chriſt,</hi> firm to his will, and zealous of his glory. And verily it muſt be qualified, in reference both to <hi>God,</hi> and man: like that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſets forth in his Epiſtles. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the thirteenth Chapter of his firſt to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> beginning at the fourth verſe. <hi>Love ſuffereth long</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>&amp; is kinde: it envieth not, it vaunteth not it ſelf, is not puffed up, doth not behave it ſelf unſeemly, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not her own, is not eaſily provoked, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no evil, rejoyceth not in iniquity, but rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth</hi>
                  <pb n="401" facs="tcp:123675:209"/> 
                  <hi>in the truth, it beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he that ſhall according to this <hi>love:</hi> (or to a <hi>love</hi> not much unlike to this) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in thoſe deſignes, which he hath firſt begun by <hi>faith:</hi> he may be confident, that (if his <hi>patience</hi> be anſwerable) he hath attained to the power of <hi>godlineſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore it remains, that we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: what kinde of <hi>patience</hi> will be ſuteable, and proper to continue our ingagements.</p>
               <p>For we do finde four kindes of <hi>patience:</hi> Namely, a <hi>patience</hi> of falſehood.</p>
               <p>A <hi>patience</hi> of folly. A <hi>patience</hi> of force. And a <hi>patience of hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt (I ſay) is a <hi>patience</hi> of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or a falſe pernitious <hi>patience.</hi> And this is, when a man diſſembleth his anger, till he can finde a fitting opportunity, to do the greater miſchief. Thus hatefull <hi>Eſau</hi> did conceal his anger, that he conceiv'd againſt his brother <hi>Jacob. And he ſaid in his heart, the dayes of mourning for my father are at hand: then will I ſlay my brother</hi> Jacob, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. 41.</p>
               <p>And thus proud <hi>Haman</hi> did diſſemble his, againſt good <hi>Mordecay</hi> for near twelve moneths: <hi>For he thought ſcorn to lay hands on</hi> Mordecay <hi>alone,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eſther</hi> 3. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>Untill he falls upon that curſed decree,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:123675:210"/> to deſtroy, to kill, and to cauſe to periſh all <hi>Jews,</hi> both young and old, little Children, and women in one day, as <hi>verſe</hi> 13.</p>
               <p>This is a falſe treacherous <hi>patience,</hi> or a <hi>patience</hi> with a miſchief.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is a <hi>patience</hi> of folly: A fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and a partial patience. And this is, when a man can hear, or ſee <hi>Gods</hi> glory vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, or abuſed, or in his name, or truth, or Ordinances, and not to be moved, or offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at it. Alas, how hot, and furious we are, in the defence of our own reputation: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſcarce be worth the ſpeaking of. But in <hi>Gods</hi> caſe, we are as calm and cool, as if we had nor ſpleen, nor ſpirit in us.</p>
               <p>We read that <hi>Jehu</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nimſhi</hi> was very zealous in deſtroying the poſterity of the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving all obſtructions, and impediments, that might hinder, or moleſt his poſſeſſion in the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Nevertheleſſe, he was ſo patient in reference to the ſins of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the ſon of <hi>Nebat,</hi> who made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin; that he departed not from after them. <hi>To wit, the golden Calves that were in</hi> Bethel, <hi>and that were in</hi> Dan, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10. 26. For theſe he ſuppoſed to be as ſupporters to eſtabliſh him in his Throne: According to <hi>Jeroboams</hi> firſt intention, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12. 26.</p>
               <pb n="403" facs="tcp:123675:210"/>
               <p> And may there not be ſome in theſe our dayes, that are very zealous to root out Monarchy, Magiſtracy, and Miniſtery: which zeal they <hi>(Jehu</hi> like) proclaim to be for the <hi>Lord.</hi> Notwithſtanding, they continue their Golden Calves of covetouſneſſe and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whileſt un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er the colour of liberty of conſcience, every one that is factious may do that, which is right in his own eyes.</p>
               <p>We finde likewiſe that <hi>Eli</hi> was ſo zealous for the Ark of <hi>God,</hi> that when he heard it was taken by the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> he fell down and died, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 14. But he was ſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in relation to the ſins of his own ſons, that he thereby provoked the <hi>Lord</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a fearfull curſe upon his whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3. 13. &amp;c. And are there not amongſt us that will rage, and inveigh very bitterly againſt the leaſt miſtakes of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, as ſcandalous, and therefore execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: whereas they can with much patience paſſe by the lewd proceedings of their friends, and followers, as humane frailties, therefore tollerable. I cannot ſay but this kinde of <hi>patience</hi> may be of credit with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates: But I conceive, it was not ſo with the Apoſtles: I am ſure it was otherwiſe with impartial <hi>Paul: when</hi> Peter <hi>came to</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, <hi>I withſtood him to the face, becauſe he</hi>
                  <pb n="404" facs="tcp:123675:211"/> 
                  <hi>was to be blamed,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Be angry, but ſin not:</hi> ſaith the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 26.</p>
               <p>Aſſuredly this purblinde <hi>patience</hi> is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the right Chriſtian <hi>zeal;</hi> neither complying with the work of <hi>faith,</hi> nor with the labour of a godly <hi>love.</hi> And is not this a fooliſh patience, or a patience of folly? The third kinde is a <hi>patience</hi> of force.</p>
               <p>And this appeareth, when a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, that he hath juſt occaſion of offence. And no leſſe will to execute his anger, had he not ſome reſtraint impoſed on him. This we may ſee was verified in <hi>Laban,</hi> when he purſued hotly after <hi>Jacob: It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but the God of your father ſpake unto me yeſternight, ſaying, take thou heed, that thou ſpeak not to</hi> Jacob, <hi>either good, or bad,</hi> Gen. 31. 29.</p>
               <p>How often would the High <hi>Prieſts, Scribes,</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> have ſeized upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> before the time, but that they feared the people.</p>
               <p>And thus the <hi>Lord</hi> doth oftentimes ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the fury of his Churches adverſaries, either by their confuſion: As he dealt with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Exod. 13. 23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Or he reſtraineth them to their converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: For thus he dealt with perſecuting
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:123675:211"/> 
                  <hi>Saul,</hi> who afterwards was alſo called <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 13. 9.</p>
               <p>And he that was made patient by force, now teacheth us the <hi>Patience</hi> of <hi>Hope.</hi> This is the fourth, and laſt kinde of <hi>patience:</hi> A hopefull, and a happy <hi>patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the right way to poſſeſſe our ſouls in matter of deſertion, or death, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 19.</p>
               <p>By this we wait upon the <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>God</hi> without repining, murmuring, or offence, even in the greateſt tryals, or diſtreſſes. <hi>Ye have heard of the patience of</hi> Job (ſaith Saint <hi>James) and have ſeen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very pitifull, and of tender mercie,</hi> Jam. 5. 11.</p>
               <p>This <hi>patience</hi> expecteth no reward, but what the <hi>Lord</hi> is pleaſed to allow, and ſhe as willingly will wait his leiſure, for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his gracious favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If we hope for that we ſee not, then do we with patience wait for it,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8. 25. <hi>Be of good courage therefore, and he ſhall ſtrengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. 24.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay but <hi>patience</hi> may miſcarry: And <hi>hope</hi> deferred, may make the heart ſick. But this <hi>Patience</hi> of <hi>Hope</hi> in our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> who is the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>patience,</hi> and of <hi>hope,</hi> Rom. 15. 5, 13.</p>
               <pb n="406" facs="tcp:123675:212"/>
               <p> This verily is ſuch a threefold cord, as never can be broken. And thus, according to this <hi>patience,</hi> we muſt continue, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the work, begun by <hi>faith,</hi> and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in by <hi>love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For let this patience have her perfect work, and ye ſhall be perfect, and entire, wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:</hi> According to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Ja.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
               <p>And when our actions ſhall be underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by ſuch a <hi>faith,</hi> as onely reſpecteth <hi>Gods</hi> Commands: and laboured in by ſuch a <hi>love,</hi> as onely affecteth <hi>Gods</hi> glory: and continued by ſuch a <hi>patience,</hi> as onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth <hi>Gods</hi> favour,</p>
               <p>Then we may certainly aſſure our Souls, they have brought forth the fruit of <hi>godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And to confirm you further in this <hi>Rule,</hi> I ſhall preſent you with ſome few examples.</p>
               <p>Behold it firſt, in father <hi>Abraham.</hi> In that great work of offering up his ſon: He un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes it firſt by <hi>Gods</hi> command, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 1, 2. And therefore in the obedience of <hi>faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Secondly, his labour is of <hi>love:</hi> of love to <hi>God,</hi> For in compariſon of that his <hi>love</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> he <hi>loved</hi> not his Son, his onely Son.</p>
               <pb n="407" facs="tcp:123675:212"/>
               <p> Thirdly, his willingneſſe did manifeſt his <hi>patience:</hi> his <hi>patience</hi> of <hi>hope, who againſt hope believed in hope,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
               <p>See it again in <hi>Joſephs</hi> abſtinence, His Miſtris courts him to commit a ſin, odious to <hi>God,</hi> injurious to his Maſter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he could not but <hi>believe,</hi> it was the minde of <hi>God</hi> he ſhould refuſe her, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. 7. 8. And here his <hi>love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> was evident: <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and ſin againſt God,</hi> verſe 9.</p>
               <p>And was it not a ſign of <hi>Patience,</hi> that he would rather ſuffer then accuſe his luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miſtris, or excuſe his own abuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, <hi>as,</hi> verſe 20.</p>
               <p>We likewiſe find this power of <hi>godlineſſe</hi> in the three children (as we uſe to call them) In <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The king injoyns them to fall down, and worſhip his golden image, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>A thing quite oppoſite to <hi>Gods</hi> command, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 4, 5.</p>
               <p>And therefore in obedience to <hi>faith,</hi> they diſobey his heatheniſh injunction: For <hi>they anſwered and ſaid. O Nebuchad-nezzar we are not carefull to anſwer thee in this matter: our God whom we ſerve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will</hi>

                  <hi>deliver us out of thine hand, O King. But if not, be it known unto thee, O King, that we will not ſerve thy gods, nor worſhip thy golden image which thou haſt ſet up,</hi> Dan. 3. 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>In which reply it likewiſe may appear, they <hi>loved God</hi> more deerly then their lives. Nor is their <hi>patience</hi> leſſe obſervable, in that they went to their intended torture, without recanting, murmuring, or repining. As <hi>verſe</hi> 21. Yet one example more, and that from <hi>Paul:</hi> The author of this <hi>Rule,</hi> this <hi>Golden Chain,</hi> and in relation to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, unto the which he was commiſſionated by <hi>God in Chriſt,</hi> Acts 9. 15, 16. Which is yet more exactly ſet forth, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 15, &amp;c. And ſet his matchleſſe <hi>love</hi> unto his <hi>Lord,</hi> in his undaunted reſolution, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 22. to 26.</p>
               <p>And with what <hi>patience of hope</hi> in our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> he ſuffered the afflictions of the Goſpel, it may moſt perfectly appear unto us: in that he gloried in ſuch tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We glorie in tribulation alſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh not aſhamed, &amp;c.</hi> Rom. 5. 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p>Now theſe, and every work of the like
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:123675:213"/> nature; whether it be: of doing, or of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of ſpeech, of action, or of abſtinence, begotten by <hi>God</hi> in the womb of <hi>faith,</hi> and born unto <hi>God</hi> by the hand of <hi>love,</hi> and nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for <hi>God</hi> at the breaſt of <hi>patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the ſweet <hi>fruit,</hi> which the teem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Soul</hi> doth uſually bring forth unto her <hi>husband:</hi> to <hi>God in Chriſt her husband.</hi> And therefore it may very well be called, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto <hi>Gods</hi> name, <hi>Godlineſſe,</hi> or after <hi>Chriſts</hi> name, <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not ſay, that ever any man (except the <hi>Son of God,</hi> both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man)</hi> did ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and exactly ſteer his courſe according unto theſe points. But, I ſay, that he which failes in any one of theſe: ſo far he falleth ſhort of <hi>godlineſſe.</hi> And yet 'tis not denied, but he may be a godly man that oftentimes doth miſſe to ſhape his actions to theſe principles: Provided, that his heart be well diſpoſed; that his deſires be orderly, and good, and his endeavours vigorous and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</p>
               <p>A Ship at Sea may ſometimes be becalm'd, and ſometimes weather-beaten by a ſtorm, ſo as ſhe cannot keep a ſteady courſe: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the winde may ſet ſo ſore againſt her, that you would think her ſailing to a Coaſt, far diſtant from the Port, that ſhe intendeth.</p>

               <p>Even ſo the precious Soul may ſometimes want Divine aſſiſtance: ſometimes ſuch a ſtorm of ſtrong temptations may circumvent her, as may inforce her from her good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, or Satan in his malice, may beſet her, with ſome ſuch difficulties, as may drive her far diſtant from the courſe of her endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. And yet the body joyned with this Soul, is a good godly perſon, and ſo full, both of the ſeed and fruit of <hi>godlineſſe:</hi> That he may lay a warrantable claim, unto the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of eternal life, as a joynt Heir with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt his Lord:</hi> through the obedience of <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> by vertue of that <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For God ſo loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi>
